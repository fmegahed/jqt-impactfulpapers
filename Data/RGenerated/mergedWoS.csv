"1","identifying and visualizing part-to-part variation with spatially dense optical dimensional metrology data","article","dimensional metrology; optical metrology; manifold learning; principal component analysis; independent component analysis","optical dimensional metrology (odm) technology that produces spatially dense surface measurement data is increasingly employed for quality-control purposes in discrete parts manufacturing. such data contain a wealth of information on the surface dimensional characteristics of individual parts and on the nature of part-to-part variation. the large body of prior quality-control work on analyzing dimensional metrology data has focused heavily on fitting parametric geometric features such as circles or planes to the data for individual parts and checking whether the features are within specifications; and subsequent analysis of part-to-part variation is restricted to those specific features. in this article, we present an approach for identifying and visualizing the nature of part-to-part variation in a more general manner that is not restricted to a prespecified set of parametric features. the basis for the approach is manifold learning applied to the collective odm data for a set of measured parts. particular emphasis is on handling the extremely high dimensionality of odm data.","[shi, zhenyu] true x, los angeles, ca usa; [apley, daniel w.] northwestern univ, dept ind engn & management sci, 2145 sheridan rd, evanston, il 60208 usa; [runger, george c.] arizona state univ, sch comp informat & decis syst engn, tempe, az usa","apley, dw (reprint author), northwestern univ, dept ind engn & management sci, 2145 sheridan rd, evanston, il 60208 usa.","apley dw, 2007, iie trans, v39, p691, doi 10.1080/07408170600899573; apley dw, 2010, j qual technol, v42, p36; apley dw, 2003, technometrics, v45, p220, doi 10.1198/004017003000000041; apley dw, 2001, technometrics, v43, p84, doi 10.1198/00401700152404354; del castillo e, 2015, technometrics, v57, p87, doi 10.1080/00401706.2013.879075; donoho d.l., 2005, natl acad sci, v102, p7426; dowling mm, 1997, technometrics, v39, p3, doi 10.2307/1270764; harding k, 2013, proc spie, v8839, doi 10.1117/12.2023525; hocken rj, 2005, ann cirp, v54, p169; hulting f. l, 1992, comput sci stat, v24, p160; hyvarinen a, 1999, ieee t neural networ, v10, p626, doi 10.1109/72.761722; lee hy, 2004, int j flex manuf sys, v16, p45, doi 10.1023/b:flex.0000039172.84756.39; lee ja, 2007, inform sci stat, p1; martinez s, 2010, int j adv manuf tech, v46, p621, doi 10.1007/s00170-009-2106-8; morey b, 2010, manuf eng, v145, p67; roweis st, 2000, science, v290, p2323, doi 10.1126/science.290.5500.2323; sammon jw, 1969, ieee t comput, vc 18, p401, doi 10.1109/t-c.1969.222678; schwenke h, 2002, cirp ann-manuf techn, v51, p685, doi 10.1016/s0007-8506(07)61707-7; shan xm, 2008, technometrics, v50, p332, doi 10.1198/004017008000000316; shi zy, 2016, technometrics, v58, p371, doi 10.1080/00401706.2015.1049751; smith a. k., 2007, recent adv data mini, p691; tenenbaum jb, 2000, science, v290, p2319, doi 10.1126/science.290.5500.2319; torgerson ws, 1952, psychometrika, v17, p401; yang l, 2004, int c patt recog, p303, doi 10.1109/icpr.2004.1334180; zhang zy, 2004, siam j sci comput, v26, p313, doi 10.1137/s1064827502419154","25","0","0","0","0","taylor & francis inc","2019","3","20","18","shi, zhenyu; apley, daniel w.; runger, george c.","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"
"2","a new variable selection method based on svm for analyzing supersaturated designs","article","linear models; recursive feature elimination; supersaturated designs; support vector machines; svr-rfe","supersaturated designs (ssds) are designs whose factors exceeds run size; thus, there are not enough runs for estimating all the main effects. they are commonly used in screening experiments, where the primary goal is to identify the few, but dominant, active factors, keeping the cost as low as possible. the development of new statistical methods inspired by machine learning algorithms is increasing rapidly, especially nowadays. one of such methods is the support vector machine recursive feature elimination (svm-rfe), which manages to extract the informative genes in classification problems, while it achieves extremely high performance. in this article, we study a variable selection method for regression problems, called svr-rfe, to screen active effects in both two-level and mixed-level designs. simulation studies demonstrate that this procedure is effective enough, especially in terms of statistical power.","[drosou, krystallenia;

"3","an integer linear programing approach to find trend-robust run orders of experimental designs","article","factorial designs; mixed integer program; multistage approach; orthogonality; response surface designs; trend robustness","when a multifactor experiment is carried out over a period of time, the responses may depend on a time trend. unless the tests of the experiment are conducted in proper order, the time trend has a negative impact on the precision of the estimates of the main effects, the interaction effects, and the quadratic effects. a proper run order, called a trend-robust run order, minimizes the confounding between the effects' contrast vectors and the time trend's linear, quadratic, and cubic components. finding a trend-robust run order is essentially a permutation problem. we develop a multistage approach based on integer programing to find a trend-robust run order for any given design. the multistage nature of our algorithm allows us to prioritize the trend robustness of the main-effect estimates. in the literature, most of the methods used are tailored to specific designs and are not applicable to an arbitrary design. additionally, little attention has been paid to trend-robust run orders of response surface designs, such as central composite designs, box-behnken designs, and definitive screening designs. our algorithm succeeds in identifying trend-robust run orders for arbitrary factorial designs and response surface designs with two up to six factors.","[ares, jose nunez; goos, peter] katholieke univ leuven, dept biosyst, leuven, belgium; [goos, peter] univ antwerp, dept engn management, antwerp, belgium","ares, jn (reprint author), kasteelpk arenberg 30,box 2456, b-3001 leuven, belgium.","atkinson ac, 1996, technometrics, v38, p333, doi 10.2307/1271304; bailey ra, 1992, stat sinica, v2, p393; box g, 1960, technometrics, v2, p455, doi doi 10.1080/00401706.1960.10489912; box gep, 1951, j roy stat soc b, v13, p1; box gep, 1953, biometrics, v9, p304, doi 10.2307/3001706; capehart s. r., 2011, int j expt design pr, v2, p34, doi doi 10.1504/ijedpo.2011.038050; carrano al, 2006, j manuf syst, v25, p39, doi 10.1016/s0278-6125(06)80031-2; cheng cs, 1988, j am stat assoc, v83, p1152, doi 10.2307/2290148; cook s. a., 1971, proceedings of the 3rd annual acm symposium on theory of computing, p151; cox dr, 1951, biometrika, v38, p312, doi 10.2307/2332577; daniel c, 1966, technometrics, v8, p259, doi 10.2307/1266360; dhanasekaran s, 2012, int j chem react eng, v10, p1; fisher r. a., 1963, stat tables biol agr; garey mr, 1979, computers intractabi; hartley ho, 1959, biometrics, v15, p610; hinkelmann k, 1998, j stat plan infer, v72, p347, doi 10.1016/s0378-3758(98)00042-1; john pwm, 1990, technometrics, v32, p275, doi 10.2307/1269104; joiner bl, 1976, technometrics, v18, p249, doi 10.2307/1268734; jones b, 2011, j qual technol, v43, p1; kreutz c, 2009, febs j, v276, p923, doi 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06843.x; montgomery d. c., 2012, int j expt design pr, v3, p111, doi [10.1504/ijedpo.2012.049297, doi 10.1504/ijedpo.2012.049297]; robson ds, 1959, biometrics, v15, p187, doi 10.2307/2527668; sartono b, 2015, technometrics, v57, p428, doi 10.1080/00401706.2014.938832; sartono b, 2015, technometrics, v57, p488, doi 10.1080/00401706.2014.958198; tack l, 2002, j qual technol, v34, p422; tack l, 2001, j stat plan infer, v98, p293, doi 10.1016/s0378-3758(00)00299-8; tan p., 2014, intro data mining; van der reyden d, 1957, thesis; villarreal-marroquin mg, 2017, polym eng sci, v57, p248, doi 10.1002/pen.24405","29","0","0","0","0","taylor & francis inc","2019","37","50","14","ares, jose nunez; goos, peter","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"

"5","strategic allocation of test units in an accelerated degradation test plan","article","compromise test plan; general path model; large sample approximate variance; order statistics; random initial degradation; reliability","degradation is often defined in terms of the change of a key performance characteristic over time. when the degradation is slow, accelerated degradation tests (adts) that apply harsh test conditions are often used to obtain reliability information in a timely manner. it is common to see that the initial performance of the test units varies and it is strongly correlated with the degradation rate. motivated by a real application in the semiconductor sensor industry, this study advocates an allocation strategy in adt planning by capitalizing on the correlation information. in the proposed strategy, the initial degradation levels of the test units are measured and the measurements are ranked. the ranking information is used to allocate the test units to different factor levels of the accelerating variable. more specifically, we may prefer to allocate units with lower degradation rates to a higher factor level in order to hasten the degradation process. the allocation strategy is first demonstrated using a cumulative-exposure degradation model. likelihood inference for the model is developed. the optimum test plan is obtained by minimizing the large sample variance of a lifetime quantile at nominal use conditions. various compromise plans are discussed. a comparison of the results with those from traditional adts with random allocation reveals the value of the proposed allocation rule. to demonstrate the broad applicability, we further apply the allocation strategy to two more degradation models which are variants of the cumulative-exposure model.","[ye, zhi-sheng] natl univ singapore, dept ind syst engn & management, singapore, singapore; [hu, qingpei; yu, dan] chinese acad sci, acad math & syst sci, beijing, peoples r china","hu, qp (reprint author), chinese acad sci, acad math & syst sci, beijing, peoples r china.","bae sj, 2004, technometrics, v46, p460, doi 10.1198/004017004000000464; bedford t, 2006, stat sci, v21, p460, doi 10.1214/088342306000000510; boulanger m, 1994, technometrics, v36, p260, doi 10.2307/1269370; hamada ms, 2008, springer ser stat, p1; hong lq, 2017, stat sinica, v27, p1461, doi 10.6706/ss.202015.0357; hu ch, 2015, eur j oper res, v241, p412, doi 10.1016/j.ejor.2014.09.003; jeng sl, 2011, ieee t reliab, v60, p701, doi 10.1109/tr.2011.2161051; jevtic mm, 1995, microelectron reliab, v35, p455, doi 10.1016/0026-2714(95)93070-q; kim sj, 2013, reliab eng syst safe, v110, p68, doi 10.1016/j.ress.2012.09.010; klein a, 2000, linear algebra appl, v321, p209, doi 10.1016/s0024-3795(99)00045-2; lee my, 2007, stat sinica, v17, p873; lim h, 2011, j appl stat, v38, p309, doi 10.1080/02664760903406488; liu x, 2010, qual reliab eng int, v26, p863, doi 10.1002/qre.1151; lu jc, 1997, technometrics, v39, p391, doi 10.2307/1271503; meeker wq, 1998, stat methods reliabi; shea bl, 1988, j r stat soc c-appl, v37, p151; shi y, 2012, ieee t reliab, v61, p245, doi 10.1109/tr.2011.2170115; shi y, 2009, technometrics, v51, p1, doi 10.1198/tech.2009.0001; si xs, 2012, ieee t reliab, v61, p50, doi 10.1109/tr.2011.2182221; tsai cc, 2012, ieee t reliab, v61, p604, doi 10.1109/tr.2012.2194351; tseng st, 2016, technometrics, v58, p244, doi 10.1080/00401706.2015.1033109; tseng st, 2003, nav res log, v50, p1, doi 10.1002/nav.10042; weaver bp, 2014, appl stoch model bus, v30, p658, doi 10.1002/asmb.2061; weaver bp, 2013, technometrics, v55, p122, doi 10.1080/00401706.2012.715838; xiao x, 2016, ieee t reliab, v65, p1327, doi 10.1109/tr.2016.2575442; ye zs, 2015, appl stoch model bus, v31, p16, doi 10.1002/asmb.2063; ye zs, 2014, ieee t reliab, v63, p750, doi 10.1109/tr.2014.2315773; ye zs, 2014, technometrics, v56, p302, doi 10.1080/00401706.2013.830074; yu hf, 2006, j stat plan infer, v136, p282, doi 10.1016/j.jspi.2004.06.030; yuan xx, 2009, reliab eng syst safe, v94, p509, doi 10.1016/j.ress.2008.06.013; zhai q., 2017, technometrics, v60, p461","31","0","0","0","0","taylor & francis inc","2019","64","80","17","ye, zhi-sheng; hu, qingpei; yu, dan","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"

"9","multiple profiles sensor-based monitoring and anomaly detection","article","data fusion; functional pca; multichannel profile monitoring; statistical process control","generally, in an advanced manufacturing system hundreds of sensors are deployed to measure key process variables in real time. thus it is desirable to develop methodologies to use real-time sensor data for on-line system condition monitoring and anomaly detection. however, there are several challenges in developing an effective process monitoring system: (i) data streams generated by multiple sensors are high-dimensional profiles; (ii) sensor signals are affected by noise due to system-inherent variations; (iii) signals of different sensors have cluster-wise features; and (iv) an anomaly may cause only sparse changes of sensor signals. to address these challenges, this article presents a real-time multiple profiles sensor-based process monitoring system, which includes the following modules: (i) preprocessing sensor signals to remove inherent variations and conduct profile alignments, (ii) using multichannel functional principal component analysis (mfpca)-based methods to extract sensor features by considering cluster-wise between-sensor correlations, and (iii) constructing a monitoring scheme with the top-r strategy based on the extracted features, which has scalable detection power for different fault patterns. finally, we implement and demonstrate the proposed framework using data from a real manufacturing system.","[zhang, chen] tsinghua univ, dept ind engn, beijing, peoples r china; [yan, hao] arizona state univ, sch comp informat & decis syst engn, tempe, az usa; [lee, seungho] samsung elect, suwon, south korea; [shi, jianjun] georgia inst technol, h milton stewart sch ind & syst engn, atlanta, ga 30332 usa","shi, jj (reprint author), room 109,groseclose bldg,765 ferst dr, atlanta, ga 30332 usa.","ding y, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p199; ghashghaei r, 2017, qual reliab eng int, v33, p767, doi 10.1002/qre.2055; grasso m, 2014, int j prod res, v52, p6110, doi 10.1080/00207543.2014.916431; jackson je, 1979, technometrics, v21, p341, doi 10.2307/1267757; jensen wa, 2008, j qual technol, v40, p167; jin jh, 1999, technometrics, v41, p327, doi 10.2307/1271349; jin jh, 2001, j intell manuf, v12, p257, doi 10.1023/a:1011248925750; keogh e, 2005, knowl inf syst, v7, p358, doi 10.1007/s10115-004-0154-9; kim j, 2006, j manuf sci e-t asme, v128, p944, doi 10.1115/1.2193552; lee sp, 2011, j qual technol, v43, p142; liu kb, 2015, technometrics, v57, p305, doi 10.1080/00401706.2014.947005; mahmoud ma, 2004, technometrics, v46, p380, doi 10.1198/004017004000000455; mei y, 2010, biometrika, v97, p419, doi 10.1093/biomet/asq010; mei yj, 2011, 2011 ieee international symposium on information theory proceedings (isit); nomikos p, 1995, technometrics, v37, p41, doi 10.2307/1269152; noorossana r, 2010, comput ind eng, v58, p563, doi 10.1016/j.cie.2009.12.003; noorossana r, 2010, qual reliab eng int, v26, p291, doi 10.1002/qre.1066; noorossana r., 2011, stat anal profile mo, v865; paynabar k, 2016, technometrics, v58, p191, doi 10.1080/00401706.2015.1042168; paynabar k, 2013, iie trans, v45, p1235, doi 10.1080/0740817x.2013.770187; paynabar k, 2011, iie trans, v43, p275, doi 10.1080/0740817x.2010.521807; qiu ph, 2010, technometrics, v52, p265, doi 10.1198/tech.2010.08188; tartakovsky a.g., 2006, stat methodol, v3, p252, doi 10.1016/j.stamet.2005.05.003; thorndike rl, 1953, psychometrika, v18, p267, doi doi 10.1007/bf02289263; tibshirani r, 2001, j roy stat soc b, v63, p411, doi 10.1111/1467-9868.00293; walker e, 2002, j qual technol, v34, p118; woodall william h., 2007, prod., v17, p420, doi 10.1590/s0103-65132007000300002; yu g, 2012, technometrics, v54, p308, doi 10.1080/00401706.2012.694781; zhang c, 2016, j qual technol, v48, p139; zhou sy, 2006, ieee t autom sci eng, v3, p60, doi 10.1109/tase.2005.859655; zou cl, 2007, technometrics, v49, p395, doi 10.1198/004017007000000164; zou cl, 2012, ann oper res, v192, p3, doi 10.1007/s10479-010-0797-8; zou cl, 2008, technometrics, v50, p512, doi 10.1198/004017008000000433","33","0","0","2","2","taylor & francis inc","2018","344","362","19","zhang, chen; yan, hao; lee, seungho; shi, jianjun","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"

"12","spatially weighted pca for monitoring video image data with application to additive manufacturing","article","image-based process monitoring; in-situ defect detection; k-means clustering; principal component analysis; selective laser melting","machine vision systems for in-line process monitoring in advanced manufacturing applications have attracted an increasing interest in recent years. one major goal is to quickly detect and localize the onset of defects during the process. this implies the use of image-based statistical process monitoring approaches to detect both when and where a defect originated within the part. this study presents a spatiotemporal method based on principal component analysis (pca) to characterize and synthetize the information content of image streams for statistical process monitoring. a spatially weighted version of the pca, called st-pca, is proposed to characterize the temporal auto-correlation of pixel intensities over sequential frames of a video-sequence while including the spatial information related to the pixel location within the image. the method is applied to the detection of defects in metal additive manufacturing processes via in-situ high-speed cameras. a k-means clustering-based alarm rule is proposed to provide an identification of defects in both time and space. a comparison analysis based on simulated and real data shows that the proposed approach is faster than competitor methods in detecting the defects. a real case study in selective laser melting (slm) of complex geometries is presented to demonstrate the performances of the approach and its practical use.","[colosimo, bianca m.;

"13","change detection in a dynamic stream of attributed networks","article","extended kalman filter; generalized linear model; state-space model; temporal change","while anomaly detection in static networks has been extensively studied, only recently have researchers focused on dynamic networks. this trend is mainly due to the capacity of dynamic networks to represent complex physical, biological, cyber, and social systems. this article proposes a new methodology for modeling and monitoring dynamic attributed networks for quick detection of temporal changes in network structures. in this methodology, the generalized linear model (glm) is used to model static attributed networks. this model is then combined with a state transition equation to capture the dynamic behavior of the system. extended kalman filter (ekf) is used as an online, recursive inference procedure to predict and update network parameters over time. in order to detect changes in the underlying mechanism of edge formation, prediction residuals are monitored through an exponentially weighted moving average (ewma) control chart. the proposed modeling and monitoring procedure is examined through simulations for attributed binary and weighted networks. email communication data from the enron corporation is used as a case study to show how the method can be applied in real-world problems.","[gahrooei, mostafa reisi; paynabar, kamran] georgia inst technol, sch ind & syst engn, 765 ferst dr, atlanta, ga 30332 usa","paynabar, k (reprint author), georgia inst technol, sch ind & syst engn, 765 ferst dr, atlanta, ga 30332 usa.","azarnoush b, 2016, j qual technol, v48, p28; barabasi al, 1999, science, v286, p509, doi 10.1126/science.286.5439.509; duan d. y, 2009, 1 acm int worksh com; fahrmeir l., 1991, metrika, v38, p37; frank o, 1986, j am stat assoc, v81, p832, doi 10.2307/2289017; goldenberg a, 2010, found trends mach le, v2, p129, doi 10.1561/2200000005; hanneke s, 2010, electron j stat, v4, p585, doi 10.1214/09-ejs548; hirose s, 2009, 15 acm sigkdd int c; hoff pd, 2002, j am stat assoc, v97, p1090, doi 10.1198/016214502388618906; kalman r, 1960, j basic eng, v82, p35, doi [10.1115/1.3662552, doi 10.1115/1.3662552]; kim m, 2012, internet math, v8, p113, doi 10.1080/15427951.2012.625257; kleinberg j, 2002, adv neur in, v14, p431; koutra d., 2013, arxiv13044657; koutra d, 2012, 16 panh c inf pci pi; ljung l, 1998, system identificatio; marchette d, 2012, wires comput stat, v4, p466, doi 10.1002/wics.1217; mccullagh p., 1989, gen linear models, v37; mcculloh i., 2011, detecting change lon; mcculloh i, 2009, cmuisr09104 carn mel; myers r.h., 2012, gen linear models ap, v791; neil j, 2013, technometrics, v55, p403, doi 10.1080/00401706.2013.822830; papadimitriou p, 2010, j internet serv appl, v1, p19, doi 10.1007/s13174-010-0003-x; perry mb, 2013, comput stat data an, v68, p170, doi 10.1016/j.csda.2013.06.019; philip s. y., 2006, 6 int c dat min hong; priebe c. y., 2005, computational & mathematical organization theory, v11, p229, doi 10.1007/s10588-005-5378-z; ranshous s, 2015, wires comput stat, v7, p223, doi 10.1002/wics.1347; renyi a., 1959, publ math-debrecen, v6, p290, doi doi 10.1234/12345678; sarkar p., 2005, sigkdd explor newsl, v7, p31, doi doi 10.1145/1117454.1117459; singh ak, 2011, 2011 ieee international conference on industrial technology (icit); sparks r, 2013, arxiv13097721; sun j, 2006, 12 acm sigkdd int c; wang ss, 2012, int j prod res, v50, p3137, doi 10.1080/00207543.2011.597788; watts dj, 1998, nature, v393, p440, doi 10.1038/30918; woodall w. h, 2016, arxiv160309453; xu ks, 2014, ieee j-stsp, v8, p552, doi 10.1109/jstsp.2014.2310294","35","0","0","1","1","taylor & francis inc","2018","418","430","13","gahrooei, mostafa reisi; paynabar, kamran","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"
"14","space-time outlier identification in a large ground deformation data set","article","big data; outlier detection; spatial-temporal","a novel application for outlier detection is in ground deformation monitoring. during any type of underground construction in urban settings, sensors are placed on the ground surface to monitor the vertical displacement with the goal of ensuring that there is no substantial heaving or settling of the ground. as a result, a large spatial-temporal data set is produced, but the sensors are often very sensitive, and spurious readings are commonly observed, resulting in both random and systematic outliers. in this work, we present a novel, fast spatial-temporal quality control procedure that is designed to remove these spurious readings prior to subsequent ground deformation monitoring. first, a robust kriging model is applied to the spatial ground deformations at each time point to remove systematic errors; next, an exponential moving average model is applied to the time series of ground deformations at each station to remove random outliers. a case study using ground deformation data when four subway tunnels are bored under a railyard in queens, new york is used to illustrate the methodology. methods used to construct outlier bounds are described, and the accuracy of our outlier detection approach is evaluated by calculating the percentages of outliers detected in an introduced artificial outlier set.","[yu, youjiao; workman, austin; hering, amanda s.] baylor univ, dept stat sci, waco, tx 76712 usa; [grasmick, jacob g.; mooney, michael a.] colorado sch mines, ctr underground construct & tunneling, golden, co 80401 usa","hering, as (reprint author), baylor univ, dept stat sci, waco, tx 76712 usa.","anderson an, 2016, int j climatol, v36, p28, doi 10.1002/joc.4327; bobbia m, 2015, atmos pollut res, v6, p476, doi 10.5094/apr.2015.053; cerioli a, 1999, j comput graph stat, v8, p239, doi 10.2307/1390635; chandola v, 2009, acm comput surv, v41, doi 10.1145/1541880.1541882; cressie n, 1985, j int ass math geol, v17, p563, doi 10.1007/bf01032109; fasso a, 2007, environmetrics, v18, p245, doi 10.1002/env.837; filzmoser p, 2005, comput geosci-uk, v31, p579, doi 10.1016/j.cageo.2004.11.013; filzmoser p, 2008, comput stat data an, v52, p1694, doi 10.1016/j.csda.2007.05.018; filzmoser p, 2014, stat pap, v55, p29, doi 10.1007/s00362-013-0524-z; genton mg, 1998, math geol, v30, p213, doi 10.1023/a:1021728614555; harrou f, 2016, process saf environ, v100, p220, doi 10.1016/j.psep.2016.01.015; journel ag, 1978, mining geostatistics; kou y., 2003, 3 ieee int c dat min; matheron g., 1962, traite geostatistiqu; miller mk, 2009, mater charact, v60, p461, doi 10.1016/j.matchar.2009.02.007; miller mk, 2012, mater today, v15, p158, doi 10.1016/s1369-7021(12)70069-x; pebesma ej, 2004, comput geosci-uk, v30, p683, doi 10.1016/j.cargo.2004.03.012; ribeiro j. r., 2001, r news, v1, p15, doi doi 10.1007/s10651-006-0020-x; rousseeuw p. j., 2005, robust regression ou, v589; shaby ba, 2012, environmetrics, v23, p638, doi 10.1002/env.2178; stahel w. a., 2011, isi 58 world stat c; sun y, 2017, environmetrics, v28, doi 10.1002/env.2431; sun y, 2012, environmetrics, v23, p54, doi 10.1002/env.1136; thompson a., 2015, 5 int s geot saf ris; wang ad, 2014, j qual technol, v46, p359; welsh ah, 1997, handb stat, v15, p343","26","0","0","1","1","taylor & francis inc","2018","431","445","15","yu, youjiao; workman, austin; grasmick, jacob g.; mooney, michael a.; hering, amanda s.","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"

"17","uncertainty quantification of machining simulations using an in situ emulator","article","computer experiments; gaussian process; kriging; metamodeling; monte carlo methods","understanding the uncertainty in simulation outputs is important for careful decision-making regarding a machining process. however, monte carlo-based methods cannot be used for evaluating the uncertainty when the simulations are computationally expensive. an alternative approach is to build an easy-to-evaluate emulator to approximate the computer model and run the monte carlo simulations on the emulator. although this approach is very promising, it becomes inefficient when the computer model is highly nonlinear and the region of interest is large. most machining simulations are of this kind because the output is affected by several quantitative factors-such as the workpiece material properties, cutting tool parameters, and process parameters whose effects can change depending on other qualitative factors such as the type of materials, tool designs, and tool paths. because the number of levels of the qualitative factors can range from tens to thousands, building an accurate emulator is not an easy task. this article proposes a new approach, called an in situ emulator, to overcome this problem. the idea is to build an emulator for the user-specified levels of the qualitative factors and inside the local region defined by the input uncertainty distribution of the quantitative factors. efficient experimental design and statistical modeling techniques are used for constructing the in situ emulator. the approach is illustrated using the simulations of two solid end milling processes.","[gul, evren] precima, chicago, il 60631 usa; [joseph, v. roshan; melkote, shreyes n.] georgia inst technol, atlanta, ga 30332 usa; [yan, huan] wells fargo & co, charlotte, nc usa","joseph, vr (reprint author), georgia inst technol, stewart sch ind & syst engn, 755 ferst dr nw, atlanta, ga 30332 usa.","ba s, 2015, technometrics, v57, p479, doi 10.1080/00401706.2014.957867; diazdelao fa, 2013, comput struct, v120, p24, doi 10.1016/j.compstruc.2013.01.013; dwight r. p., 2009, 20092276 aiaa; fang kt, 2006, ch crc comp sci data, p3; gramacy rb, 2015, j comput graph stat, v24, p561, doi 10.1080/10618600.2014.914442; helton jc, 2006, reliab eng syst safe, v91, p1175, doi 10.1016/j.ress.2005.11.017; helton jc, 2003, reliab eng syst safe, v81, p23, doi 10.1016/s0951-8320(03)00058-9; hung y, 2015, technometrics, v57, p35, doi 10.1080/00401706.2013.869263; joseph vr, 2016, qual eng, v28, p42, doi 10.1080/08982112.2015.1100452; joseph vr, 2015, biometrika, v102, p371, doi 10.1093/biomet/asv002; kleijnen jpc, 2017, eur j oper res, v256, p1, doi 10.1016/j.ejor.2016.06.041; mak s., 2018, ann stat; myers rh, 2016, response surface met; qian pzg, 2009, biometrika, v96, p945, doi 10.1093/biomet/asp044; ronen y., 1988, uncertainty anal; sacks j., 1989, stat sci, v4, p409, doi doi 10.1214/ss/1177012413; santner t. j., 2003, design anal computer; tomovic r., 1978, intro system sensiti; wana h. p., 2014, eng struct, v75, p557; wu c. f. j., 2009, expt planning anal p; xia z, 2013, j vib acoust, v135, doi 10.1115/1.4023998","21","0","0","1","1","taylor & francis inc","2018","253","261","9","gul, evren; joseph, v. roshan; yan, huan; melkote, shreyes n.","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"

"19","surrogate model-based optimal feed-forward control for dimensional-variation reduction in composite parts' assembly processes","article","composites assembly processes; feed-forward control; latin hypercube sampling; surrogate model; variation reduction","dimension control and variation reduction are vital for composite parts' assembly processes. due to the nonlinear properties of composites, physics-based models cannot accurately and efficiently approximate the assembly processes. in addition, conventional robust parameter design (rpd) and statistical process control (spc) cannot actively compensate for dimensional errors or prevent defects. this article proposes a surrogate model-based optimal feed-forward control strategy for dimensional-variation reduction and defect prevention in the assembly of composite parts. the objective is accomplished by (i) developing a grouped latin hypercube sampling approach tailored to the problem; (ii) adopting a universal kriging model for dimensional prediction and then em bedding the model into an optimal feed-forward control algorithm; and (iii) conducting a multiobjective optimization to determine the control actions. a case study reveals that the developed methodology can effectively reduce the mean and standard deviation of dimensional deviations for the assembly of composite parts.","[yue, xiaowei; shi, jianjun] georgia inst technol, h milton stewart sch ind & syst engn, 755 ferst dr nw, atlanta, ga 30332 usa","shi, jj (reprint author), georgia inst technol, h milton stewart sch ind & syst engn, 755 ferst dr nw, atlanta, ga 30332 usa.","camacho e. f., 2013, model predictive con; deb k, 2002, ieee t evolut comput, v6, p182, doi 10.1109/4235.996017; deb k., 2001, wil int s sys opt; dorf r. c., 2011, modern control syste; forrester a. i. j., 2008, eng design via surro; hayeck g. t., 2009, thesis cornell u; izquierdo l. e., 2007, t namri sme, v35, p295; jin j, 1999, j manuf sci e-t asme, v121, p756, doi 10.1115/1.2833137; jones r. m, 1998, mech composite mater; joseph vr, 2008, stat sinica, v18, p171; joseph vr, 2015, biometrika, v102, p371, doi 10.1093/biomet/asv002; leifsson l., 2013, surrogate based mode; lekivetz r, 2015, qual reliab eng int, v31, p829, doi 10.1002/qre.1640; liu sc, 1997, j manuf sci e-t asme, v119, p368, doi 10.1115/1.2831115; loose jp, 2009, iie trans, v41, p893, doi 10.1080/07408170902906027; mantripragada r, 1999, ieee t robotic autom, v15, p124, doi 10.1109/70.744608; mckay md, 2000, technometrics, v42, p55, doi 10.2307/1271432; menassa r., 1989, cirp ann-manuf techn, v38, p165; montgomery d.c., 2007, intro stat quality c; qian pzg, 2012, j am stat assoc, v107, p393, doi 10.1080/01621459.2011.644132; ramesh r, 2000, int j mach tool manu, v40, p1235, doi 10.1016/s0890-6955(00)00009-2; santner t. j., 2003, design anal computer; shi j, 2006, stream variation mod; shi j., 2016, j manufacturing sci, v138; shi j., 2016, j manufacturing sci, v138; shi j, 2013, p 5 man eng soc int; stein m, 1987, technometrics, v29, p143, doi 10.2307/1269769; tang b, 1993, j am stat assoc, v88, p1392, doi 10.2307/2291282; wen yc, 2018, j manuf syst, v46, p272, doi 10.1016/j.jmsy.2018.01.008; wu c. j., 2011, expt planning anal o; yue xw, 2018, j manuf sci e-t asme, v140, doi 10.1115/1.4038510; zhong j, 2010, ieee t autom sci eng, v7, p724, doi 10.1109/tase.2009.2038714; zhou q, 2012, j mech design, v134, doi 10.1115/1.4005440","33","0","0","7","7","taylor & francis inc","2018","279","289","11","yue, xiaowei; shi, jianjun","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"

"26","robust split-plot designs for model misspecification","article","a-efficiency; coordinate-exchange algorithm; d-efficiency; generalized least squares; loss function; mean squared error","many existing methods for constructing optimal split-plot designs, such as d-optimal or a-optimal designs, focus only on minimizing the variance of the parameter estimates for the fitted model. however, the true model is usually more complicated; hence, the fitted model is often misspecified. if significant effects not included in the model exist, then the estimates could be highly biased. therefore a good split-plot design should be able to simultaneously control the variance and the bias of the estimates. in this article, i propose a new method for constructing optimal split-plot designs that are robust under model misspecification. four examples are provided to demonstrate that my method can produce efficient split-plot designs with smaller overall aliasing. simulation studies are performed to verify that the robust designs i construct have high power, low false discovery rate, and small mean squared error.","[lin, chang-yun] natl chung hsing univ, dept appl math, taichung 40227, taiwan; [lin, chang-yun] natl chung hsing univ, inst stat, taichung 40227, taiwan","lin, cy (reprint author), natl chung hsing univ, dept appl math, taichung 40227, taiwan.; lin, cy (reprint author), natl chung hsing univ, inst stat, taichung 40227, taiwan.","bingham d, 2003, technometrics, v45, p80, doi 10.1198/004017002188618725; bingham d, 1999, technometrics, v41, p62, doi 10.2307/1270995; bingham dr, 1999, ann stat, v27, p1240; bingham dr, 2001, j qual technol, v33, p2; dumouchel w, 1994, technometrics, v36, p37, doi 10.2307/1269197; fisher r, 1925, stat methods res wor; goos p, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p162; goos p, 2005, comput stat data an, v49, p201, doi 10.1016/j.csda.2004.05.032; goos p, 2003, technometrics, v45, p235, doi 10.1198/004017003000000050; goos p, 2001, j qual technol, v33, p436; goos p, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p12; goos p, 2007, j qual technol, v39, p326; huang p, 1998, technometrics, v40, p314, doi 10.2307/1270532; jones b, 2007, j roy stat soc c-app, v56, p347, doi 10.1111/j.1467-9876.2007.00581.x; jones b, 2011, technometrics, v53, p62, doi 10.1198/tech.2010.09113; jones b, 2009, j qual technol, v41, p340; letsinger jd, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p381; lin cy, 2015, j qual technol, v47, p351; lin dkj, 2013, can j stat, v41, p325, doi 10.1002/cjs.11174; mukerjee r, 2002, stat sinica, v12, p885; mukerjee r, 2016, ann i stat math, v68, p787, doi 10.1007/s10463-015-0509-x; tichon jg, 2012, j stat plan infer, v142, p1407, doi 10.1016/j.jspi.2011.12.019; trinca la, 2001, technometrics, v43, p25, doi 10.1198/00401700152404291; trinca la, 2015, technometrics, v57, p145, doi 10.1080/00401706.2014.915235; vining gg, 2005, j qual technol, v37, p115; wilmut m, 2011, j stat plan infer, v141, p576, doi 10.1016/j.jspi.2010.07.002; yang p., 2017, anal methods, v10, p1, doi [10.1007/s12161-016-0781-2, doi 10.1007/s12161-016-0781-2]; yin y, 2015, ann i stat math, v67, p673, doi 10.1007/s10463-014-0470-0; zhou j, 2001, commun stat-theor m, v30, p21, doi 10.1081/sta-100001556; zhou j, 2008, j stat plan infer, v138, p4081, doi 10.1016/j.jspi.2008.03.013","30","1","1","1","1","taylor & francis inc","2018","76","87","12","lin, chang-yun","0.5","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0"

"31","a data-level fusion approach for degradation modeling and prognostic analysis under multiple failure modes","article","big data; condition monitoring; data fusion; health index; multiple sensors","operating units, in practice, often suffer from multiple modes of failure, and each failure mode has a distinct influence on the service life cycle path of a unit. the rapid development of sensor and communication technologies has enabled multiple sensors to simultaneously monitor and track the health status of a unit in real time. however, one challenging question that remains to be resolved is how to leverage data from multiple sensors for better degradation modeling and prognostic analysis, especially when there are multiple failure modes. currently, many of the existing approaches in prognostics either (a) fail to capture the dependency between sensors and instead focus on analyzing each sensor independently or (b) fail to incorporate the failure-mode diagnosis for better degradation modeling and prognostics during condition monitoring. to address the limitations in the existing literature, we propose a data-level fusion methodology to construct a composite failure-mode index, named fm-index, via the fusion of multiple sensor data. our goal is to utilize the fm-index to better characterize the failure mode of an operating unit in real time, thus leading to better degradation modeling and prognostic analysis. a case study that involves the degradation data set of an aircraft gas turbine engine with two potential failure modes is conducted to numerically evaluate the performance of our proposed method compared to other techniques in the related literature.","[chehade, abdallah] univ michigan, dept ind & mfg syst engn, dearborn, mi 48128 usa;

"33","reliability analysis considering dynamic material local deformation","article","advanced high-strength steel; digital image correlation; multivariate general path model; tensile process; two-stage parameter estimation; variance-based failure criterion","material deformation is one of the major causes of material failure. in a dynamic deformation process, local deformation-defined as the displacement of various local points on a material-essentially determines the failure. most existing studies on material reliability are conducted based on either the failure time or the degradation data. the studies do not consider the dynamic local deformation of materials and often are not efficient enough to model the failure mechanism. in this article, we develop reliability analysis by using information contained in the dynamic local deformation of materials in a tensile process. specifically, a new multivariate general-path model is proposed to describe the deformation process. a two-stage method is developed to estimate the model parameters and overcome the computational complexity. based on the proposed model, reliability analyses are conducted for various cases of material deformation paths. a simulation study is implemented to verify and validate the developed methods. physical experiments are designed and conducted to demonstrate the proposed model.","[si, wujun;

"35","uncertainty quantification for monotone stochastic degradation models","article","coverage probability; gamma process; generalized pivotal quantity; inverse gaussian process","degradation data are an important source of product reliability information. two popular stochastic models for degradation data are the gamma process and the inverse gaussian (ig) process, both of which possess monotone degradation paths. although these two models have been used in numerous applications, the existing interval estimation methods are either inaccurate given a moderate sample size of the degradation data or require a significant computation time when the size of the degradation data is large. to bridge this gap, this article develops a general framework of interval estimation for the gamma and ig processes based on the method of generalized pivotal quantities. extensive simulations are conducted to compare the proposed methods with existing methods under moderate and large sample sizes. degradation data from capacitors are used to illustrate the proposed methods.","[chen, piao] inst high performance comp, singapore, singapore","ye, zs (reprint author), natl univ singapore, dept ind syst engn & management, 1 engn dr 2, singapore 117576, singapore.","abramowitz  m., 1972, hdb math functions f; bae sj, 2004, technometrics, v46, p460, doi 10.1198/004017004000000464; bagdonavicius v, 2001, lifetime data anal, v7, p85, doi 10.1023/a:1009629311100; chen p, 2017, technometrics, v59, p115, doi 10.1080/00401706.2015.1096827; chhikara rs, 1975, commun stat, v4, p1081, doi 10.1080/03610917508548526; cisewski j, 2012, ann stat, v40, p2102, doi 10.1214/12-aos1030; fisher ra, 1960, technometrics, v2, p209, doi [10.1080/00401706.1960.10489895, doi 10.1080/00401706.1960.10489895]; guida m, 2012, reliab eng syst safe, v105, p73, doi 10.1016/j.ress.2011.12.016; hannig j, 2006, j am stat assoc, v101, p254, doi 10.1198/016214505000000736; hong yl, 2010, stat probabil lett, v80, p733, doi 10.1016/j.spl.2010.01.003; hu y, 2015, reliab eng syst safe, v134, p19, doi 10.1016/j.ress.2014.10.003; iliopoulos g, 2016, j stat comput sim, v86, p1635, doi 10.1080/00949655.2015.1080705; ko h, 2010, nature, v468, p286, doi 10.1038/nature09541; krishnamoorthy k, 2008, j stat plan infer, v138, p2082, doi 10.1016/j.jspi.2007.09.005; lawless j, 2004, lifetime data anal, v10, p213, doi 10.1023/b:lida.0000036389.14073.dd; lehmann e. l., 2006, testing stat hypothe; li y, 2015, plos one, v10, doi 10.1371/journal.pone.0130814; liao ht, 2013, iie trans, v45, p964, doi 10.1080/0740817x.2012.705451; lidong e, 2008, j am stat assoc, v103, p854, doi 10.1198/016214508000000229; meeker wq, 2014, qual eng, v26, p102, doi 10.1080/08982112.2014.846119; meeker wq, 1998, stat methods reliabi; moghaddass r, 2014, iie trans, v46, p131, doi 10.1080/0740817x.2013.770188; padgett wj, 2004, lifetime data anal, v10, p191, doi 10.1023/b:lida.0000030203.49001.b6; park c, 2006, ieee t reliab, v55, p379, doi 10.1109/tr.2006.874937; peng ww, 2017, ieee t reliab, v66, p84, doi 10.1109/tr.2016.2635149; peng ww, 2016, ieee t reliab, v65, p624, doi 10.1109/tr.2015.2513038; pitman ejg, 1991, commun stat theory, v20, p3423; tsai cc, 2012, ieee t reliab, v61, p604, doi 10.1109/tr.2012.2194351; wang x, 2010, technometrics, v52, p188, doi 10.1198/tech.2009.08197; wang x, 2010, j multivariate anal, v101, p340, doi 10.1016/j.jmva.2008.12.007; wang zq, 2014, reliab eng syst safe, v132, p186, doi 10.1016/j.ress.2014.07.015; weerahandi s, 1993, j am stat assoc, v88, p899, doi 10.2307/2290779; ye zs, 2015, appl stoch model bus, v31, p16, doi 10.1002/asmb.2063; ye zs, 2014, technometrics, v56, p302, doi 10.1080/00401706.2013.830074; ye zs, 2013, ieee t reliab, v62, p772, doi 10.1109/tr.2013.2284733; zhai qq, 2018, technometrics, v60, p461, doi 10.1080/00401706.2017.1375994; zhai qq, 2017, ieee t ind inform, v13, p2911, doi 10.1109/tii.2017.2684821","37","2","2","6","6","taylor & francis inc","2018","207","219","13","chen, piao; ye, zhi-sheng","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","0"

(2005) in the sense that it works for a broader set of designs and for replicates other than center-point replicates. our lack-of-fit test also generalizes the test proposed by khuri (1992) for data from blocked experiments because it exploits replicates other than center-point replicates and works for split-plot and other multi-stratum designs as well. we provide analytical expressions for the test statistic and the corresponding degrees of freedom and demonstrate how to perform the lack-of-fit test in the sas procedure mixed. we re-analyze several published data sets and discover a few instances in which the usual response surface model exhibits significant lack of fit.","[goos, peter] katholieke univ leuven, fac biosci engn, leuven, belgium; [goos, peter] katholieke univ leuven, leuven stat res ctr lstat, leuven, belgium; [goos, peter] univ antwerp, antwerp, belgium; [gilmour, steven g.] kings coll london, dept math, stat, london, england; [goos, peter] univ antwerp, fac appl econ, antwerp, belgium; [goos, peter] univ antwerp, statua ctr stat, antwerp, belgium","goos, p (reprint author), katholieke univ leuven, fac biosci engn, leuven, belgium.; goos, p (reprint author), katholieke univ leuven, leuven stat res ctr lstat, leuven, belgium.; goos, p (reprint author), univ antwerp, antwerp, belgium.; goos, p (reprint author), univ antwerp, fac appl econ, antwerp, belgium.; goos, p (reprint author), univ antwerp, statua ctr stat, antwerp, belgium.","almini aa, 2009, j qual technol, v41, p272; box gep, 2007, response surfaces mi; commission internationale de l'eclairage, 1986, col orimetry cie pub, v15; gilmour s. g., 2006, response surface met, p19; gilmour sg, 2000, commun stat-theor m, v29, p2157, doi 10.1080/03610920008832601; gilmour sg, 2005, j agr biol envir st, v10, p50, doi 10.1198/10857110x29029; gilmour sg, 1999, j r stat soc c-appl, v48, p91, doi 10.1111/1467-9876.00142; gilmour sg, 2012, j r stat soc c-appl, v61, p345, doi 10.1111/j.1467-9876.2011.01000.x; hinkelmann k., 2008, design anal expt int, vi; jones b, 2009, biometrika, v96, p67, doi 10.1093/biomet/asn070; kenward mg, 1997, biometrics, v53, p983, doi 10.2307/2533558; khadim m. m., 2012, thesis; khuri ai, 1992, technometrics, v34, p26, doi 10.2307/1269549; khuri ai, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p177; mcculloch c. e., 2008, gen linear mixed mod; nelder ja, 1965, proc r soc lon ser-a, v283, p147, doi 10.1098/rspa.1965.0012; parker pa, 2007, j qual technol, v39, p376; simpson jr, 2004, qual reliab eng int, v20, p481, doi 10.1002/qre.661; trinca l. a., 2017, technometri in press; trinca la, 2000, comput stat data an, v33, p25, doi 10.1016/s0167-9473(99)00033-x; vining gg, 2008, j qual technol, v40, p394; vining gg, 2005, j qual technol, v37, p115","22","1","1","0","1","amer soc quality control-asqc","2017","320","336","17","goos, peter; gilmour, steven g.","0.33","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0"

"43","optimal experimental design for efficient optical manipulation of magnetic beads seeded in a microwell array","article","brownian motion; control treatment; d-optimal design; i-optimal design; microwell array; optimal experimental design; six-level categorical factor","problem: in the field of genomics, proteomics and disease diagnostics, it is of great interest to capture individual targets (e.g., cells, bacteria, exosomes) on magnetic beads and to seed them in a microwell array. optical manipulation of the magnetic beads in the array then allows selecting the targets of interest and moving them to another location for post analysis. however, this technology is hampered by the low fraction of beads that show brownian motion within their microwell and thus can be optically trapped and manipulated. this is due to the fact that magnetic beads seeded in a microwell array are subject to attraction forces that cause them to adhere to the microwell surfaces. the challenge is to identify buffer conditions that prevent this from happening. approach: we investigated five factors that were believed to influence the fraction of magnetic beads that show brownian motion within their microwell. to this end, we used an experimental approach to maximize the fraction of beads showing brownian motion. first, an initial d-optimal five-factor completely randomized design was created, including specific control treatments, for the estimation of a response surface model including a two-level and a six-level categorical factor (bead type and type of surfactant). subsequently, two i-optimal follow-up experiments were conducted to examine the effectiveness of higher levels for one of the quantitative factors under investigation. results: the initial d-optimal five-factor design indicated one insignificant quantitative factor. the remaining four factors all had a significant main effect. in addition, there were three significant interaction effects and one significant quadratic effect. the analysis of the data from the initial experimental design also revealed a strongly positive effect for two of the six surfactants. in the follow-up experiment, these two surfactants turned out to produce even larger predicted responses at higher concentrations.","[decrop, d.; lammertyn, j.] katholieke univ leuven, mebios, willem de croylaan 42, b-3001 heverlee, belgium; [goos, p.] katholieke univ leuven, mebios, kasteelpk arenberg 30, b-3001 heverlee, belgium; [goos, p.] univ antwerp, fac appl econ, stadscampus,prinsstr 13, b-2000 antwerp, belgium; [goos, p.] univ antwerp, statua ctr stat, stadscampus,prinsstr 13, b-2000 antwerp, belgium","decrop, d (reprint author), katholieke univ leuven, mebios, willem de croylaan 42, b-3001 heverlee, belgium.","atkinson a. c., 2007, optimum expt designs; atkinson ac, 1989, biometrika, v76, p515, doi 10.2307/2336117; cook rd, 1989, technometrics, v31, p339, doi 10.2307/3556143; goos p, 2006, comput stat data an, v51, p1075, doi 10.1016/j.csda.2005.11.003; goos p, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p12; goos p, 2001, comput stat data an, v37, p433, doi 10.1016/s0167-9473(01)00010-x; goos p., 2011, optimal design expt; goos p, 2016, j am stat assoc, v111, p899, doi 10.1080/01621459.2015.1136632; jones b, 2015, j qual technol, v47, p301; jones b, 2012, j qual technol, v44, p85; kokalj t., 2015, new biotechnology, v32; montgomery dc, 2012, design anal expt, v2; otzen d, 2011, bba-proteins proteom, v1814, p562, doi 10.1016/j.bbapap.2011.03.003; patist a, 2000, j surfactants deterg, v3, p53, doi 10.1007/s11743-000-0113-4; rissin dm, 2010, nat biotechnol, v28, p595, doi 10.1038/nbt.1641; rodriguez m, 2010, j qual technol, v42, p3; tekin hc, 2013, lab chip, v13, p4711, doi 10.1039/c3lc50477h; wilson dh, 2011, clin chem, v57, p1712, doi 10.1373/clinchem.2011.169540; witters d, 2013, lab chip, v13, p2047, doi 10.1039/c3lc50119a; wu dl, 2015, analyst, v140, p6277, doi 10.1039/c5an01238d","20","0","0","5","9","amer soc quality control-asqc","2017","402","417","16","decrop, d.; lammertyn, j.; goos, p.","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"
"44","inference on an adaptive accelerated life test with application to smart-grid data-acquisition-devices","article","adaptive test; log-location-scale distribution; order statistics; step-stress test; type-i censoring","an accelerated life test (alt) is often well planned to yield the most statistical information given limited test resources. nevertheless, alt planning requires rough estimates of the model parameters as an input, called planning values. the discrepancy between the planning values and the true values may result in insufficient or even no failures at the low-stress level, making the subsequent data analysis difficult. motivated by the need in the alts of data acquisition devices used in smart grids, an adaptive alt scheme is proposed. the key idea is based on the observation that, when the product reliability is underestimated during the alt design phase, it is unlikely to observe failures at the early stage of the test. therefore, the low-stress level should be elevated to protect against insufficient failures. under this adaptive alt framework, order statistics techniques are used to derive the likelihood function by assuming a general log location-scale distribution for the product lifetime. confidence intervals for the parameters are constructed based on the large-sample approximation as well as the accelerated bootstrap method. a simulation study is conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the adaptive alt compared with the simple constant-stress alt. its application is illustrated using the motivating example from smart grids.","[shen, lijuan] china elect power res inst, beijing, peoples r china; [sun, dayu; zhao, xingqiu] hong kong polytech univ, dept appl math, hong kong, hong kong, peoples r china; [ye, zhisheng] natl univ singapore, dept ind & syst engn, singapore, singapore","shen, lj (reprint author), china elect power res inst, beijing, peoples r china.","[anonymous], 2009, 3742 qgdw stat grid; arnold bc, 1992, 1 course order stat; bagdonavicius v., 2010, accelerated life mod; balakrishnan n, 2012, ann i stat math, v64, p303, doi 10.1007/s10463-010-0309-2; chen n, 2016, ieee t reliab, v65, p901, doi 10.1109/tr.2015.2500368; chen p, 2016, ieee t reliab, v65, p1737, doi 10.1109/tr.2016.2604298; efron  bradley, 1994, intro bootstrap; ginebra j, 1998, ieee t reliab, v47, p261, doi 10.1109/24.740498; guan q, 2014, commun stat-simul c, v43, p1852, doi 10.1080/03610918.2013.810257; han d, 2013, nav res log, v60, p541, doi 10.1002/nav.21551; liao ht, 2010, nav res log, v57, p472, doi 10.1002/nav.20415; lin ct, 2014, j stat comput sim, v84, p819, doi 10.1080/00949655.2012.729313; liu x, 2011, ieee t reliab, v60, p712, doi 10.1109/tr.2011.2160748; meeker wq, 1985, plan accelerated lif, v10; nelson w, 1976, technometrics, v18, p105, doi 10.2307/1267923; nelson w, 1980, ieee t reliab, v29, p103, doi 10.1109/tr.1980.5220742; nelson wb, 2009, accelerated testing; pan r, 2014, j qual technol, v46, p114; tang lc, 2010, j qual technol, v42, p103; wang bx, 2014, ieee t reliab, v63, p807, doi 10.1109/tr.2014.2313804; xu ac, 2015, appl math model, v39, p6183, doi 10.1016/j.apm.2015.01.066; ye zs, 2013, ann appl stat, v7, p2249, doi 10.1214/13-aoas666; yuan t, 2012, ieee t reliab, v61, p254, doi 10.1109/tr.2011.2170104; zhang d, 2014, iie trans, v46, p1031, doi 10.1080/0740817x.2013.876127","24","2","2","3","14","amer soc quality control-asqc","2017","191","212","22","shen, lijuan; sun, dayu; ye, zhisheng; zhao, xingqiu","0.67","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","0"

"46","selecting an informative/discriminating multivariate response for inverse prediction","article","calibration; errors in variables; glass composition; nuclear forensics; total least squares","inverse prediction is important in a variety of scientific and engineering applications, such as to predict properties/characteristics of an object by using multiple measurements obtained from it. inverse prediction can be accomplished by inverting parameterized forward models that relate the measurements (responses) to the properties/characteristics of interest. sometimes forward models are computational/science based; but often, forward models are empirically based response surface models, obtained by using the results of controlled experimentation. for empirical models, it is important that the experiments provide a sound basis to develop accurate forward models in terms of the properties/characteristics (factors). while nature dictates the causal relationships between factors and responses, experimenters can control the complexity, accuracy, and precision of forward models constructed via selection of factors, factor levels, and the set of trials that are performed. recognition of the uncertainty in the estimated forward models leads to an errors-in-variables approach for inverse prediction. the forward models (estimated by experiments or science based) can also be used to analyze how well candidate responses complement one another for inverse prediction over the range of the factor space of interest. one may find that some responses are complementary, redundant, or noninformative. simple analysis and examples illustrate how an informative and discriminating subset of responses could be selected among candidates in cases where the number of responses that can be acquired during inverse prediction is limited by difficulty, expense, and/or availability of material.","[thomas, edward v.; lewis, john r.] sandia natl labs, pob 5800, albuquerque, nm 87185 usa; [anderson-cook, christine m.; burr, tom; hamada, michael s.] los alamos natl lab, stat sci grp, los alamos, nm 87545 usa; [burr, tom] iaea, vienna, austria","thomas, ev (reprint author), sandia natl labs, pob 5800, albuquerque, nm 87185 usa.","anderson-cook c, 2015, chemometr intell lab, v149, p107, doi 10.1016/j.chemolab.2015.07.008; anderson-cook cm, 2015, stat anal data min, v8, p364, doi 10.1002/sam.11278; anderson-cook cm, 2009, j stat plan infer, v139, p629, doi 10.1016/j.jspi.2008.04.004; aster r. c., 2013, parameter estimation; box g. e., 1987, empirical model buil; daniels mj, 2001, biometrics, v57, p1173, doi 10.1111/j.0006-341x.2001.01173.x; fuller wa, 1987, measurement error mo; goldberg d. e., 1989, genetic algorithms s; haaland dm, 1988, anal chem, v60, p1193, doi 10.1021/ac00162a020; krasnopolsky vm, 2003, neural networks, v16, p321, doi 10.1016/s0893-6080(03)00027-3; krutchkoff rg, 1967, technometrics, v9, p425, doi 10.2307/1266511; martens h., 1987, multivariate calibra; messingerrapport bj, 1986, ieee t bio-med eng, v33, p667, doi 10.1109/tbme.1986.325756; mitchell d. j., 2014, sand201419465; moody kj, 2014, nucl forensic anal; myers r. h, 2009, response surface met; nelson c., 1986, sand860430; sun nz, 1994, inverse problems gro; taflove a., 2005, computational electr; thomas e. v., 1993, sand930010; thomas ev, 2010, ieee nucl sci conf r, p902, doi 10.1109/nssmic.2010.5873892; thomas ev, 1991, technometrics, v33, p405, doi 10.2307/1269413; van huffel s, 1991, total least squares","23","3","3","0","3","amer soc quality control-asqc","2017","228","243","16","thomas, edward v.; lewis, john r.; anderson-cook, christine m.; burr, tom; hamada, michael s.","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","1"
"47","using definitive screening designs to identify active first- and second-order factor effects","article","dantzig selector; foldover design; lasso; model selection; supersaturated design","definitive screening designs (dsds) were recently introduced by jones and nachtsheim (2011b). the use of three-level factors and the desirable aliasing structure of the dsds make them potentially suitable for identifying main effects and second-order terms in one stage of experimentation. however, as the number of active effects approaches the number of runs, the performance of standard model-selection routines will inevitably degrade. in this paper, we characterize the ability of dsds to correctly identify first and second-order model terms as a function of the level of sparsity, the number of factors in the design, the signal-to-noise ratio, the model type (unrestricted or following strong heredity), the model-selection technique, and the number of augmented runs. we find that minimum-run-size dsds can be used to identify active terms with high probability as long as the number of effects is less than or equal to about half the number of runs and the signal-to-noise ratios for the active effects are above about 2.0. we also find that if minimum-run-size designs are augmented with four or more runs, the number of model terms that can be identified with high probability increases substantially. among the model-selection methods investigated, we found that both lasso and the gauss-dantzig selector (both based on alcc) can be used to effectively identify active model terms in the presence of unrestricted models. for models following strong heredity, the shim method developed by choi et al. (2010) was the best among methods tested that were designed for the strong-heredity case.","[errore, anna; li, william; nachtsheim, christopher j.] univ minnesota, carlson sch management, minneapolis, mn 55455 usa; [jones, bradley] sas, jmp div, cary, nc usa; [errore, anna] univ minnesota, supply chain & operat dept, minneapolis, mn usa; [li, william] univ minnesota, supply chain & operat dept, business teaching & res, minneapolis, mn usa; [nachtsheim, christopher j.] univ minnesota, supply chain & operat dept, operat management, minneapolis, mn usa","errore, a (reprint author), univ minnesota, carlson sch management, minneapolis, mn 55455 usa.; errore, a (reprint author), univ minnesota, supply chain & operat dept, minneapolis, mn usa.","akaike hirotogu, 1998, inform theory extens, v1998, p199, doi doi 10.1007/978-1-4612-1694-0_; beattie sd, 2002, technometrics, v44, p55, doi 10.1198/004017002753398326; box gep, 1986, technometrics, v28, p11, doi 10.2307/1269599; burnham k. p., 2002, model selection mult; candes e, 2007, the annals of statis, p2313, doi doi 10.1214/009053606000001523; chipman h, 1997, technometrics, v39, p372, doi 10.2307/1271501; choi nh, 2010, j am stat assoc, v105, p354, doi 10.1198/jasa.2010.tm08281; draguljic d, 2014, technometrics, v56, p1, doi 10.1080/00401706.2013.775900; efron b, 2004, ann stat, v32, p407; errore a, 2017, technometrics, v59, p48, doi 10.1080/00401706.2015.1124052; hamada m, 1992, j qual technol, v24, p130; holcomb dr, 2003, j qual technol, v35, p13; hurvich cm, 1989, biometrika, v76, p297, doi 10.1093/biomet/76.2.297; jones b, 2016, technometrics, v58, p74, doi 10.1080/00401706.2015.1013777; jones b, 2013, j qual technol, v45, p121; jones b, 2011, j qual technol, v43, p1; jones b, 2011, technometrics, v53, p62, doi 10.1198/tech.2010.09113; li r., 2003, j data sci, v1, p249; li rz, 2002, stat probabil lett, v59, p135, doi 10.1016/s0167-7152(02)00140-2; li w, 2014, technometrics, v56, p21, doi 10.1080/00401706.2013.860921; li xa, 2006, complexity, v11, p32, doi 10.1002/cplx.20123; lin dkj, 1993, technometrics, v35, p28, doi 10.2307/1269286; lu x, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p392; mallows cl, 1973, technometrics, v15, p661, doi 10.2307/1267380; marley cj, 2010, comput stat data an, v54, p3158, doi 10.1016/j.csda.2010.02.017; miller a, 2005, technometrics, v47, p502, doi 10.1198/004017005000000210; miller a., 2002, subset selection reg; phoa fkh, 2009, j stat plan infer, v139, p2362, doi 10.1016/j.jspi.2008.10.023; tibshirani r, 1996, j roy stat soc b met, v58, p267; westfall ph, 1998, stat sinica, v8, p101; wu c. f. j., 2008, expt planning anal o; wu cfj, 1993, biometrika, v80, p661, doi 10.2307/2337185; xiao ll, 2012, j qual technol, v44, p2; yuan m, 2007, technometrics, v49, p430, doi 10.1198/004017007000000173; zhang qz, 2007, j stat plan infer, v137, p2068, doi 10.1016/j.jpsi.2006.06.038","35","3","3","0","6","amer soc quality control-asqc","2017","244","264","21","errore, anna; jones, bradley; li, william; nachtsheim, christopher j.","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","1"

"63","multiple objective optimization in reliability demonstration tests","article","bayesian analysis; consumer's risk; decision making; pareto front; producer's risk; trade-offs","reliability demonstration tests are usually performed in product design or validation processes to demonstrate whether a product meets specified requirements on reliability. for binomial demonstration tests, the zero-failure test has been most commonly used due to its simplicity and use of minimum sample size to achieve an acceptable consumer's risk level. however, this test can often result in unacceptably high risk for producers as well as a low probability of passing the test even when the product has good reliability. this paper explicitly explores the interrelationship between multiple objectives that are commonly of interest when planning a demonstration test and proposes structured decision-making procedures using a pareto front approach for selecting an optimal test plan based on simultaneously balancing multiple criteria. different strategies are suggested for scenarios with different user priorities and graphical tools are developed to help quantify the trade-offs between choices and to facilitate informed decision making. potential impacts of some subjective user inputs on the final decision are studied to offer insights and useful guidance for general applications.","[lu, lu] univ s florida, dept math & stat, tampa, fl 33620 usa; [li, mingyang] univ s florida, dept ind & management syst engn, tampa, fl 33620 usa; [anderson-cook, christine m.] los alamos natl lab, stat sci grp, los alamos, nm 87545 usa","lu, l (reprint author), univ s florida, dept math & stat, tampa, fl 33620 usa.","anderson-cook c. m., 2015, qual prog, v48, p42; deb k, 2009, multiobjective optim; easterling rg, 1970, ann reliability main, v9, p31; gelman a., 2004, bayesian data anal; gronwald w, 2008, bmc bioinformatics, v9, doi 10.1186/1471-2105-9-109; hamada ms, 2008, springer ser stat, p1; hart l, 1990, ieee t reliab, v39, p140, doi 10.1109/24.55871; kasprzak em, 2001, struct multidiscip o, v22, p208, doi 10.1007/s001580100138; lange k., 2013, optimization; lu l, 2011, technometrics, v53, p353, doi 10.1198/tech.2011.10087; oconnor p., 2012, practical reliabilit; pintar a, 2012, qual eng, v24, p473, doi 10.1080/08982112.2012.694334; trautmann h, 2009, eng optimiz, v41, p23, doi 10.1080/03052150802347926","13","1","1","2","6","amer soc quality control-asqc","2016","326","342","17","lu, lu; li, mingyang; anderson-cook, christine m.","0.25","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0"

spatial sign test","in multivariate statistical process control (mspc) applications, process mean shifts sometimes occur in only a few components. to solve this mspc problem, many control charts were proposed in the literature. most of these charts assumed that the multivariate quality characteristics are normally distributed. among them, the control chart proposed by zou and qiu (2009), incorporating the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) method into the ewma scheme, has the best overall performance. in this paper, we extend the classical multivariate lasso control chart to a robust version that has an affine-invariance property and is distribution free under the family of elliptical direction distributions, indicating that the in-control run-length distribution is the same for any continuous distribution in this family and the control limit can be acquired from the multivariate standard normal distribution. our simulation results show that the proposed method is very efficient in detecting various sparse shifts under heavy-tailed and skewed multivariate distributions. in addition, it is easy to implement with an iterative algorithm and the least angle regression (lars) algorithm. white-wine data illustrates that the proposed control chart performs quite well in applications.","[liang, wenjuan;

"73","a study of missing data imputation in predictive modeling of a wood-composite manufacturing process","article","imputation; lasso; mcmc; predictive modeling; variable selection","problem: real-time process data and destructive test data were collected and merged from a wood composite manufacturer in the southeastern us for the purpose of developing real-time predictive models for strength properties of manufactured particleboard. sensor malfunction and other real-time data problems lead to null fields in the company's data warehouse, resulting in information loss. many manufacturers attempt to build accurate predictive models excluding entire records with null fields or use summary statistics such as the average or median in place of the null field. however, predictive-model errors in validation may be higher in the presence of information loss and may misguide the production process. approach: this paper summarizes an application of missing-data imputation methods in predictive modeling of a wood-composite manufacturing process. variable selection was applied prior to imputing missing data. two missing data-imputation methods were selected after comparing six possible methods. predictive models of imputed data were developed using partial least squares regression (plsr) and were compared with models developed from nonimputed data. results: maximum likelihood-based imputation using the expectation-maximization (em) algorithm and multiple imputation (ml) using markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) simulation achieved lower root mean-square error of prediction results than imputation based on the mean/median substitution, last observation-carried-forward (locf), or a ""hot-deck"" method using single imputation. predictive models based on the imputed dataset generated more precise prediction results than models based on nonimputed datasets. outcomes of the study included avoiding rework and scrap when model predictions alerted of an imminent strength failure and minor reductions were made in resin input set points. senior management of the company indicated that a savings occurred as a result of the study from lower resin usage (the second highest cost component of manufactured product).","[zeng, yan] lending club, san francisco, ca 94105 usa;

"74","using curve-registration information for profile monitoring","article","curve registration; functional-data analysis; profile monitoring; warping functions","the quality characteristics in manufacturing processes are often represented in terms of spatially- or time ordered data, called ""profiles"", which are characterized by amplitude and phase variability. in this context, curve registration plays a key role, as it allows separating the two kinds of between-profiles variability and reducing any undesired inflation of the natural phase variability. in the mainstream literature, warping functions are not generally considered in the monitoring process, even though this may cause significant information loss. we propose a novel approach for profile monitoring that combines the functional principal component analysis and the use of parametric warping functions. the key idea is to jointly monitor the stability over time of the registered profiles (i.e., the information related to amplitude variability) and the registration coefficients (i.e., the information related to phase variability). this allows improving the capability of detecting unnatural pattern modifications, thanks to a better characterization of the overall natural variability. the benefits of a proper management of functional data registration, together with the advantages over the most common approaches used in the literature, are demonstrated by means of monte carlo simulations. the proposed methodology is finally applied to a real industrial case study relying on a dataset acquired in waterjet cutting processes under different health conditions of the machine tool.","[grasso, marco;

(2010). in most of the papers on synthetic charts that actually used the steady-state framework, it was not rigorously described. see khoo et al. (2011) as an exception, where it was revealed that the cyclical steady-state design was considered. the aim of this paper is to carefully analyze the steady-state (cyclical and the more popular conditional) for the synthetic chart, the original ""2 of l + 1"" (l >= 1) runs-rule chart, and competing ewma charts with two types of control limits. it turns out that the ewma chart has a uniformly (over a large range of potential shifts) better steady-state arl performance than the synthetic chart. furthermore, the synthetic control chart exhibits the poorest performance among all considered competitors. thus, we advise not applying synthetic control charts.","[knoth, sven] univ fed armed forces hamburg, helmut schmidt univ, dept math & stat, sch econ & social sci, pob 700822, d-22008 hamburg, germany","knoth, s (reprint author), univ fed armed forces hamburg, helmut schmidt univ, dept math & stat, sch econ & social sci, pob 700822, d-22008 hamburg, germany.","antzoulakos demetrios l, 2008, quality engineering, v20, p75, doi 10.1080/08982110701636401; asmussen s, 1987, appl probability que; brass h., 2011, math surveys monogra; brook d, 1972, biometrika, v59, p539; capizzi g, 2010, stat comput, v20, p23, doi 10.1007/s11222-008-9113-8; champ cw, 1992, commun stat theory, v21, p765, doi 10.1080/03610929208830813; champ cw, 1987, technometrics, v29, p393, doi 10.2307/1269449; crosier rb, 1986, technometrics, v28, p187, doi 10.2307/1269074; crowder sv, 1987, technometrics, v29, p401, doi 10.2307/1269450; darroch j., 1965, j appl probab, v2, p88; davis rb, 2002, j qual technol, v34, p200; khoo mbc, 2011, qual reliab eng int, v27, p981, doi 10.1002/qre.1189; klein m, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p427; knoth s, 1998, metrika, v48, p31; knoth s, 2005, stat pap, v46, p47, doi 10.1007/bf02762034; knoth s., 2014, spc stat process con; knoth s., 2003, sequential anal, v22, p241; knoth s, 2006, frontiers in statistical quality control 8, p74, doi 10.1007/3-7908-1687-6_5; koutras m. v., 2008, methodol comput appl, v9, p207; lai tl, 1995, j r stat soc b, v57, p613; lucas jm, 1990, technometrics, v32, p1, doi 10.2307/1269835; machado mag, 2014, int j prod res, v52, p3404, doi 10.1080/00207543.2013.879221; mises r., 1929, z angew math mech, v9, p58; moustakides gv, 2011, stat sinica, v21, p571, doi 10.5705/ss.2011.026a; nelson ls, 1984, j qual technol, v16, p237; page es, 1955, biometrika, v42, p243, doi 10.2307/2333440; page es, 1954, biometrika, v41, p100, doi 10.2307/2333009; pollak m, 2009, stat sinica, v19, p1729; roberts s., 1959, technometrics, v1, p239, doi doi 10.1080/00401706.1959.10489860; roberts sw, 1958, at&t tech j, v37, p83, doi 10.1002/j.1538-7305.1958.tb03870.x; roberts sw, 1966, technometrics, v8, p411, doi 10.2307/1266688; shewhart w. a, 1926, bell syst tech j, v5, p593, doi 10.1002/j.1538-7305.1926.tb00125.x; weco, 1958, stat qual contr hdb; wu z, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p32; wu z, 2010, int j prod res, v48, p7423, doi 10.1080/00207540903496681","35","7","7","0","9","amer soc quality control-asqc","2016","178","195","18","knoth, sven","1.75","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","3","3","1"
"79","analysis of subjective ordinal responses in mixture experiments","article","categorical data; formulation experiments; proportional odds; rated responses; stereotype","problem: this case study involves a mixture experiment with three components where the primary response, fragrance intensity, is subjectively evaluated by 40 fragrance experts using a seven-point intensity scale. the problem is motivated by the addition of two new components that are purported to enhance fragrance intensity. the common practice in analyzing ordinal ratings is to use the averaged ratings across panelists and to analyze these responses as if they were numeric. however, this approach yields results that are not meaningful and difficult to interpret because of the ordinality of the rating scale. recommendations for modeling ordinal responses from mixture experiments have not been dealt with in the literature, so the techniques described here have a broader application to other experimental settings. approach: when responses are subjectively assessed and the rating scale is arbitrarily assigned, anderson's (1984) stereotype regression model presents a flexible alternative to the widely popular proportional odds model. the modeling approach presented in this paper addresses the issue of inestimability of model parameters due to perfect collinearity among the mixture components, as well as the uncertainty in the discretization of the ordered, categorical response. for this case study, the assignment of ordinal scales to sensory levels is done in an arbitrary manner, such that no historical studies support the effectiveness of the assignment. comparisons are made among the stereotype, the proportional odds, and traditional regression modeling where the numeric averages of the ordinal responses are analyzed. results: in this case study, the stereotype model revealed that adjacent categories of the ordered, categorical response are indistinguishable with respect to the changes in the proportions of the mixture components. internal tests for indistinguishability provided statistical justification for collapsing the categories, and in so doing, the more parsimonious proportional odds form was found to satisfactorily model and improve the interpretability of the reconfigured responses. analysis revealed that one of the two new components introduced to the formula significantly improved the perception of fragrance intensity; hence, adoption of the new compound was strongly justified.","[mancenido, michelle; pan, rong; montgomery, douglas] arizona state univ, sch comp informat & decis syst engn, tempe, az usa","mancenido, m (reprint author), arizona state univ, sch comp informat & decis syst engn, tempe, az usa.","agresti a., 2010, anal ordinal categor; ahn j, 2009, stat med, v28, p3139, doi 10.1002/sim.3693; anderson ja, 1984, j r stat soc b, v46, p1; cornell j. a., 2002, expt mixtures design; derr r, 2013, sas global forum 201; high r, 2013, sas global forum 201; jamieson s, 2004, med educ, v38, p1217, doi 10.1111/j.1365-2929.2004.02012.x; kiefer j, 1959, j roy stat soc b, v21, p272; knapp tr, 1990, nurs res, v39, p121; kuss o, 2006, comput stat data an, v50, p1877, doi 10.1016/j.csda.2005.02.013; mccullagh p, 1980, j roy stat soc b met, v42, p109; norman g, 2010, adv health sci educ, v15, p625, doi 10.1007/s10459-010-9222-y; piepel gf, 2006, response surface met, p283; singh j., 1984, stat methods food co; stokes me, 2000, categorical data ana","15","1","1","0","4","amer soc quality control-asqc","2016","196","208","13","mancenido, michelle; pan, rong; montgomery, douglas","0.25","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0"

"84","a gradient approach to the optimal design of cusum charts under unknown mean-shift sizes","article","average-run length; economic loss; monte carlo simulation; statistical process control","traditional cumulative sum (cusum) control charts are often designed to optimize the detection performance for a prescribed magnitude of mean shift when monitoring the mean level of a process. however, the shift to occur in the future is often unknown. to account for the uncertainty of the shift size, different design criteria have been proposed. however, all the design methods discussed in the literature are based on monte carlo simulations, and the optimal parameters are obtained in a trial-and-error manner (e.g., ryu et al. (2010)). notice that the average-run length (arl) of the cusum chart can be formulated as an integral equation based on the recurrence relationship of the cusum charting statistics; this paper proposes a gradient-based approach for efficient design and analysis of cusum charts under unknown mean-shift sizes. the proposed method is shown to be more accurate and efficient than monte carlo simulations.","[huang, wenpo; jiang, wei] shanghai jiao tong univ, antai coll econ & management, shanghai 200030, peoples r china; [shu, lianjie] univ macau, fac business adm, beijing, peoples r china","huang, wp; jiang, w (reprint author), shanghai jiao tong univ, antai coll econ & management, shanghai 200030, peoples r china.; shu, lj (reprint author), univ macau, fac business adm, beijing, peoples r china.","bagshaw m, 1975, j roy stat soc b met, v37, p413; baker cth, 1977, numerical treatment; berger jo, 1995, stat decision theory; burden rl, 2010, numerical anal; chen a, 2007, iie trans, v39, p1127, doi 10.1080/07408170701315321; dowell m., 1971, bit (nordisk tidskrift for informationsbehandling), v11, p168, doi 10.1007/bf01934364; fu mc, 1999, manage sci, v45, p395, doi 10.1287/mnsc.45.3.395; gan ff, 1991, j qual technol, v23, p279; geol a. l., 1971, technometrics, v13, p221; han d, 2007, int j reliab qual sa, v14, p81, doi 10.1142/s0218539307002520; jiang w, 2008, iie trans, v40, p992, doi 10.1080/07408170801961412; jones la, 2002, j qual technol, v34, p277; lele s., 1996, thesis u michigan an; lorden g, 1971, ann math stat, v42, p1897, doi 10.1214/aoms/1177693055; luceno a, 2000, technometrics, v42, p411, doi 10.2307/1270951; moustakides gv, 1986, ann stat, v14, p1379, doi 10.1214/aos/1176350164; page es, 1955, biometrika, v42, p243, doi 10.2307/2333440; pollak m, 1985, ann stat, v13, p206, doi 10.1214/aos/1176346587; press w. h., 1992, numerical recipes; rao bv, 2001, iie trans, v33, p463, doi 10.1080/07408170108936845; reynolds mr, 2010, j qual technol, v42, p287; ritov y, 1990, ann stat, v18, p1464, doi 10.1214/aos/1176347761; ryu j., 2010, j qual technol, v42, p311; shu lj, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p135; siegmund david, 1985, sequential anal test; woodall wh, 1985, statistician, v34, p155, doi 10.2307/2988154; wu z, 2004, int j prod res, v42, p379, doi 10.1080/00207540310001614169; zhao y, 2005, iie trans, v37, p1047, doi 10.1080/07408170500232321","28","2","2","1","6","amer soc quality control-asqc","2016","68","83","16","huang, wenpo; shu, lianjie; jiang, wei","0.5","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","0"
"85","nonlinear profile monitoring for oven-temperature data","article","common fixed design; multivariate statistical process control; nonlinear models; phase i; principal components; temperature profiles; t-2 statistic","problem: the monitoring of a key input, temperature, in a manufacturing process produces large amounts of data. it is difficult to determine an appropriate control-chart methodology that allows the chart user to determine when there are problems with this step of the manufacturing process. current approaches for process monitoring involve the output data gathered after the process has been completed. it would be preferable to establish process monitoring on the process inputs. however, this is challenging when there is a large amount of process input data. current phase i monitoring of the process inputs involve the use of individual control charts on some selected data from the temperature profiles that represent some features determined based on expert judgment. this approach does not use all the data nor does it take into account the potential correlation that exists among the selected data. approach: we propose the use of a nonlinear model for modeling the profiles, thereby reducing the profiles to a smaller set of parameter estimates. for this nonlinear model data reduction approach, the parameter estimates and residual variability can then be used in the appropriate monitoring procedure. we show that a control chart based on the classical covariance-matrix estimate fails to detect large significant process changes, but the successive differences covariance matrix performs better. the statistic based on the successive differences is modified to account for the correlation between the profiles. we illustrate both the phase i and phase ii analysis for these data. results: the proposed data reduction approach and monitoring procedure makes use of all the available data and detects important process shifts where the interpretation of the nonlinear model parameters facilitates the root-cause investigation. this parametric approach can be easily automated using existing statistical software and results in a smaller number of control charts, which is a manageable way to determine the current state of the process. we highlight some issues that are raised by this particular dataset that have not been adequately addressed in the profile-monitoring literature.","[jensen, willis a.; espen, ben] wl gore & assoc inc, flagstaff, az usa; [grimshaw, scott d.] brigham young univ, dept stat, provo, ut 84602 usa","jensen, wa; espen, b (reprint author), wl gore & assoc inc, flagstaff, az usa.; grimshaw, sd (reprint author), brigham young univ, dept stat, provo, ut 84602 usa.","abdel-salam asg, 2013, qual reliab eng int, v29, p555, doi 10.1002/qre.1405; amiri a, 2010, qual reliab eng int, v26, p509, doi 10.1002/qre.1071; chang si, 2012, qual eng, v24, p251, doi 10.1080/08982112.2012.641149; chang si, 2010, int j prod res, v48, p1049, doi 10.1080/00207540802454799; chou sh, 2014, int j prod res, v52, p3209, doi 10.1080/00207543.2013.867088; ding y, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p199; gallant a. r, 1987, nonlinear stat model; grasso m, 2014, int j prod res, v52, p6110, doi 10.1080/00207543.2014.916431; gupta s, 2006, int j prod res, v44, p1927, doi 10.1080/00207540500409855; jensen wa, 2009, j qual technol, v41, p18; lowry ca, 1992, technometrics, v34, p46, doi 10.2307/1269551; mahmoud ma, 2004, technometrics, v46, p380, doi 10.1198/004017004000000455; mason rl, 2002, multivariate stat pr; noorossana r, 2010, comput ind eng, v58, p563, doi 10.1016/j.cie.2009.12.003; noorossana r, 2010, qual reliab eng int, v26, p291, doi 10.1002/qre.1066; noorossana r., 2011, stat anal profile mo; paynabar k, 2013, iie trans, v45, p1235, doi 10.1080/0740817x.2013.770187; qiu ph, 2010, technometrics, v52, p265, doi 10.1198/tech.2010.08188; schabenberger o, 2001, hum ecol risk assess, v7, p891, doi 10.1080/20018091094718; seber g., 2003, nonlinear regression; sullivan jh, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p398; walker e, 2002, j qual technol, v34, p118; willemain tr, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p31; williams jd, 2007, j agr biol envir st, v12, p216, doi 10.1198/108571107x197779; williams jd, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p217; woodall wh, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p309; woodall william h., 2007, prod., v17, p420, doi 10.1590/s0103-65132007000300002; zhang h, 2009, iie trans, v41, p335, doi 10.1080/07408170802323000; zou cl, 2014, iie trans, v46, p106, doi 10.1080/0740817x.2012.762486; zou cl, 2008, technometrics, v50, p512, doi 10.1198/004017008000000433","30","3","3","1","5","amer soc quality control-asqc","2016","84","97","14","jensen, willis a.; grimshaw, scott d.; espen, ben","0.75","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","2","0"
"86","optimal design of blocked experiments in the presence of supplementary information about the blocks","article","blocked experiment; concomitant variable; covariate; d-optimality; i-optimality; split-plot experiment; v-optimality","in some designed experiments, measurements of characteristics of the experimental units may be available prior to performing the runs. if the investigators believe that these measured characteristics may have some effect on the response of interest, then it seems natural to include these characteristics as factors in the experiment even though they are not under direct control. it may also be possible to apply multiple runs to a given experimental unit by subdividing it into multiple pieces, each having the same characteristics. a similar scenario involves using a person or an animal as an experimental unit multiple times but with different treatments. here, the measured information about the subjects may not change over the experiment. in either of these cases, the fact that several runs employ the same experimental unit means that the responses for those runs are correlated. this correlation, in addition to the natural variability of the measured characteristics over the sample of available experimental units, requires new methodology for creating optimal designs. specifically, the methodology must choose a subset of the experimental units and determine the number of treatments applied to each experimental unit in addition to choosing the level combinations of the controllable factors for each run. in this article, we provide two methods for generating optimal designs in the presence of additional information about the experimental units. the first method fixes the number of runs performed on each experimental unit. the second method allows for varying numbers of runs applied to each experimental unit, subject to a constraint on the total number of runs. we discuss several illustrative examples using each method as well as a real experiment using previously fabricated batches of polypropylene as experimental units in a study on the effects of a subsequent plasma treatment.","[jones, bradley] sas inst, jmp div, cary, nc 27513 usa; [goos, peter] katholieke univ leuven, fac biosci engn, louvain, belgium; [goos, peter] katholieke univ leuven, leuven stat res ctr, louvain, belgium; [goos, peter] univ antwerp, fac appl econ, antwerp, belgium; [goos, peter] univ antwerp, statua ctr stat, antwerp, belgium","jones, b (reprint author), sas inst, jmp div, cary, nc 27513 usa.","atkinson ac, 1989, biometrika, v76, p515, doi 10.2307/2336117; atkinson ac, 1996, technometrics, v38, p333, doi 10.2307/1271304; cheng c.-s, 1990, stat design anal ind, p423; cheng cs, 1991, biometrika, v78, p325; cheng cs, 1988, j am stat assoc, v83, p1152, doi 10.2307/2290148; cook rd, 1980, j am stat assoc, v75, p366, doi 10.2307/2287460; cook rd, 1989, technometrics, v31, p339, doi 10.2307/3556143; cook rd, 1980, technometrics, v22, p315, doi 10.2307/1268315; cornell j. a., 2002, expt mixtures design; daniel c, 1966, technometrics, v8, p259, doi 10.2307/1266360; fedorov v. v., 1972, theory optimal expt; goos p, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p162; goos p, 2003, technometrics, v45, p235, doi 10.1198/004017003000000050; goos p, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p12; goos p, 2001, comput stat data an, v37, p433, doi 10.1016/s0167-9473(01)00010-x; goos p., 2011, design expt case stu; goos p, 2002, optimal design block; goos p., 2006, computational stat d, v51, p1075; goos p, 2012, technometrics, v54, p340, doi 10.1080/00401706.2012.694777; hardin r. h., 1991, computer generated m; harville da, 1974, technometrics, v16, p589, doi 10.2307/1267612; hill hm, 1960, technometrics, v2, p67; john pwm, 1990, technometrics, v32, p275, doi 10.2307/1269104; joiner bl, 1976, technometrics, v18, p249, doi 10.2307/1268734; jones b, 2007, j roy stat soc c-app, v56, p347, doi 10.1111/j.1467-9876.2007.00581.x; jones b, 2012, j qual technol, v44, p85; kessels r, 2008, comput stat data an, v52, p2369, doi 10.1016/j.csda.2007.10.016; khuri ai, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p177; letsinger jd, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p381; mee rw, 2010, qual eng, v22, p306, doi 10.1080/08982112.2010.500502; meyer rk, 1995, technometrics, v37, p60, doi 10.2307/1269153; mylona k, 2014, technometrics, v56, p132, doi 10.1080/00401706.2013.818579; nachtsheim cj, 1989, j stat plan infer, v22, p203, doi 10.1016/0378-3758(89)90111-0; smith w.f., 2005, expt design formulat; vining gg, 2005, j qual technol, v37, p115; wu cfj, 2000, expt planning anal p","36","3","3","0","13","amer soc quality control-asqc","2015","301","317","17","jones, bradley; goos, peter","0.6","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","0","1"

"90","another look at the ewma control chart with estimated parameters","article","bootstrap; estimation effect; sdarl; spc; standard deviation of average run length; statistical process control","when in-control process parameters are estimated, phase ii control chart performance will vary among practitioners due to the use of different phase i data sets. the typical measure of phase ii control chart performance, the average run length (arl), becomes a random variable due to the selection of a phase i data set for estimation. aspects of the arl distribution, such as the standard deviation of the average run length (sdarl), can be used to quantify the between-practitioner variability in control chart performance. in this article, we assess the in-control performance of the exponentially weighted moving average (ewma) control chart in terms of the sdarl and percentiles of the arl distribution when the process parameters are estimated. our results show that the ewma chart requires a much larger amount of phase i data than previously recommended in the literature in order to sufficiently reduce the variation in the chart performance. we show that larger values of the ewma smoothing constant result in higher levels of variability in the in-control arl distribution; thus, more phase i data are required for charts with larger smoothing constants. because it could be extremely difficult to lower the variation in the in-control arl values sufficiently due to practical limitations on the amount of the phase i data, we recommend an alternative design criterion and a procedure based on the bootstrap approach.","[saleh, nesma a.; mahmoud, mahmoud a.] cairo univ, fac econ & polit sci, dept stat, cairo, egypt; [jones-farmer, l. allison] miami univ, dept informat syst & analyt, oxford, oh 45056 usa; [zwetsloot, inez] univ amsterdam, amsterdam, netherlands; [woodall, william h.] virginia tech, dept stat, blacksburg, va 24061 usa","saleh, na (reprint author), cairo univ, fac econ & polit sci, dept stat, cairo, egypt.","albers w, 2004, statistics, v38, p67, doi 10.1080/02669760310001619369; aly a. a., 2015, communicatio inpress; bajgier s. m, 1992, p dec sci i san dieg, p1611; chakraborti s, 2009, qual eng, v21, p52, doi 10.1080/08982110802445561; chatterjee s, 2009, ann appl stat, v3, p349, doi 10.1214/08-aoas197; chen gm, 1997, stat sinica, v7, p789; crowder sv, 1987, technometrics, v29, p401, doi 10.2307/1269450; crowder sv, 1989, j qual technol, v21, p155; derman c, 1995, probab eng inform sc, v9, p411; efron b, 1979, ann stat, v7, p1, doi 10.1214/aos/1176344552; faraz a, 2015, int j prod res, v53, p4405, doi 10.1080/00207543.2015.1008112; gandy a, 2013, scand j stat, v40, p647, doi 10.1002/sjos.12006; jensen wa, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p349; jones la, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p95; jones la, 2002, j qual technol, v34, p277; jones la, 1998, j qual technol, v30, p362; jones la, 2001, technometrics, v43, p156, doi 10.1198/004017001750386279; jones ma, 2012, int j qual health c, v24, p176, doi 10.1093/intqhc/mzr082; jones-farmer la, 2014, j qual technol, v46, p265; lee j, 2013, qual reliab eng int, v29, p639, doi 10.1002/qre.1413; liu ry, 1996, j am stat assoc, v91, p1694, doi 10.2307/2291598; lucas jm, 1990, technometrics, v32, p1, doi 10.2307/1269835; mahmoud ma, 2010, j qual technol, v42, p348; montgomery  d.c., 2013, intro stat quality c; psarakis s, 2014, qual reliab eng int, v30, p1113, doi 10.1002/qre.1556; quesenberry cp, 1993, j qual technol, v25, p237; roberts s., 1959, technometrics, v1, p239, doi doi 10.1080/00401706.1959.10489860; robinson pb, 1978, technometrics, v20, p85, doi 10.2307/1268164; saleh na, 2015, j qual technol, v47, p127; saleh na, 2013, qual reliab eng int, v29, p595, doi 10.1002/qre.1408; seppala t, 1995, j qual technol, v27, p139; simoes bft, 2010, qual technol quant m, v7, p249, doi 10.1080/16843703.2010.11673231; steiner sh, 1999, j qual technol, v31, p75; vardeman sb, 1999, iie trans, v31, p503, doi 10.1023/a:1007694121519; woodall wh, 1995, iie trans, v27, p757, doi 10.1080/07408179508936792; zhang m, 2014, qual reliab eng int, v30, p275, doi 10.1002/qre.1495; zhang m, 2013, qual reliab eng int, v29, p209, doi 10.1002/qre.1304; zwetsloot im, 2015, qual reliab eng int, v31, p989, doi 10.1002/qre.1655; zwetsloot im, 2014, j qual technol, v46, p302","39","38","38","2","16","amer soc quality control-asqc","2015","363","382","20","saleh, nesma a.; mahmoud, mahmoud a.; jones-farmer, l. allison; zwetsloot, inez; woodall, william h.","7.6","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","8","14","13","3"

"106","cluster-based profile analysis in phase i","article","control chart; mixed models; outliers; profile monitoring; robust; statistical process control","our proposed technique, referred to as cluster-based profile monitoring, incorporates a cluster-analysis phase to aid in determining the possible existence of profiles in the historical data set resulting from an out-of-control process. the proposed method first replaces the data from each sampled unit with an estimated profile, using some appropriate regression method, and clusters the profiles based on their estimated parameter vectors. this yields an initial main cluster, which contains at least half the profiles. the initial estimated parameters for the population average (pa) profile are obtained by fitting a linear mixed model to those profiles in the main cluster. profiles that are not contained in the initial main cluster may be iteratively added to the main cluster and the mixed model used to update the estimated parameters for the pa profile. those profiles contained in the final main cluster are considered as resulting from the in-control process while those not included are considered as resulting from an out-of-control process. a simulated example, a monte carlo study, and an application demonstrate the performance advantages of this proposed method over a non-cluster based method with respect to more accurate estimates of the pa parameters and improved classification performance criteria. when the profiles can be represented by m p x 1. vectors, the profile monitoring process is equivalent to the detection of multivariate outliers. for this reason, we also compare our proposed method to a popular method used to identify outliers when dealing with a multivariate response. our study demonstrates that, when the out-of-control process corresponds to a sustained shift, the cluster-based method using the successive difference estimator is clearly the superior method, among those methods we considered, based on all performance criteria.","[chen, yajuan] pfizer, andover, ma 01810 usa; [birch, jeffrey b.] virginia polytech inst & state univ, dept stat, grad programs, blacksburg, va 24061 usa; [woodall, william h.] virginia polytech inst & state univ, blacksburg, va 24061 usa","chen, yj (reprint author), pfizer, andover, ma 01810 usa.","abdel-salam asg, 2013, qual reliab eng int, v29, p555, doi 10.1002/qre.1405; amiri a, 2010, qual reliab eng int, v26, p509, doi 10.1002/qre.1071; chen y., 2014, quality rel in press; chenouri s, 2009, j qual technol, v41, p259; demidenko e., 2004, mixed models theory; ding y, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p199; fan s. k., 2013, quality reliability, v29, p975; fraker shannon e, 2008, quality engineering, v20, p451, doi 10.1080/08982110701810444; gupta s, 2006, int j prod res, v44, p1927, doi 10.1080/00207540500409855; hung yc, 2012, j process contr, v22, p397, doi 10.1016/j.jprocont.2011.12.009; jensen wa, 2008, j qual technol, v40, p167; jensen wa, 2007, qual reliab eng int, v23, p615, doi 10.1002/qre.837; jensen wa, 2009, j qual technol, v41, p18; jin jh, 1999, technometrics, v41, p327, doi 10.2307/1271349; jobe jm, 2009, j qual technol, v41, p323; jones-farmer la, 2014, j qual technol, v46, p265; kang l, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p418; kim k, 2003, j qual technol, v35, p317; laird nm, 1982, biometrics, v38, p963, doi 10.2307/2529876; lawrence de, 2014, qual reliab eng int, v30, p97, doi 10.1002/qre.1480; mahmoud ma, 2004, technometrics, v46, p380, doi 10.1198/004017004000000455; noorossana r, 2010, qual reliab eng int, v26, p291, doi 10.1002/qre.1066; noorossana r., 2011, stat anal profile mo; qiu ph, 2010, technometrics, v52, p265, doi 10.1198/tech.2010.08188; ruppert d., 2003, semiparametric regre; schabenberger o., 2002, cont stat models pla; seber g., 2003, nonlinear regression; shiau jjh, 2010, qual reliab eng int, v26, p475, doi 10.1002/qre.1075; sullivan jh, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p398; vargas nja, 2003, j qual technol, v35, p367; walker e, 2002, j qual technol, v34, p118; williams jd, 2007, j agr biol envir st, v12, p216, doi 10.1198/108571107x197779; williams jd, 2007, qual reliab eng int, v23, p925, doi 10.1002/qre.858; woodall wh, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p309; woodall william h., 2007, prod., v17, p420, doi 10.1590/s0103-65132007000300002","35","4","4","3","8","amer soc quality control-asqc","2015","14","29","16","chen, yajuan; birch, jeffrey b.; woodall, william h.","0.8","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","3","0"

"108","identification of dispersion effects from partially replicated two-level factorial designs","article","fractional factorial design; generalized p-value; minimum aberration criterion; quality improvement; screening experiment","variation reduction in industrial quality improvement is always a primary objective to reach. thus, well-designed experiments are needed to identify both location and dispersion effects to control the quality characteristic of interest around a target value with a minimal variation. analysis of dispersion effects typically requires duplicates on treatment combinations. this can lead to a costly experiment due to a large number of experimental runs. an unreplicated design with relatively fewer runs seems to be an attractive alternative for users. however, the use of an unreplicated design can be inherently difficult in the identification of the truly active effects because location and dispersion effects are possibly confounded. in this article, we promote a class of regular two-level factorial designs with partial replications, which could be considered as compromise designs in terms of cost and efficiency. also, based on the concepts of generalized p-values, we develop a statistical testing procedure to identify significant dispersion effects from the partially replicated designs. in addition, a catalogue of such designs with practical run sizes is provided for applications.","[tsai, shin-fu] feng chia univ, dept stat, taichung 40724, taiwan; [liao, chen-tuo] natl taiwan univ, inst agron, div biometry, taipei 10617, taiwan; [chai, feng-shun] acad sinica, inst stat sci, taipei 11529, taiwan","tsai, sf (reprint author), feng chia univ, dept stat, taichung 40724, taiwan.","bergman b, 1997, technometrics, v39, p191, doi 10.2307/1270907; box gep, 1986, technometrics, v28, p19, doi 10.2307/1269600; brenneman wa, 2001, technometrics, v43, p388, doi 10.1198/00401700152672483; chen jh, 1993, int stat rev, v61, p131, doi 10.2307/1403599; cook rd, 1983, biometrika, v70, p1, doi 10.1093/biomet/70.1.1; davidian m, 1987, j am stat assoc, v82, p1079, doi 10.2307/2289384; lenth rv, 1989, technometrics, v31, p469, doi 10.2307/1269997; liao ct, 2000, comput stat data an, v33, p291, doi 10.1016/s0167-9473(99)00058-4; mcgrath rn, 2001, technometrics, v43, p406, doi 10.1198/00401700152672492; mcgrath rn, 2001, j qual technol, v33, p129; nair vn, 1988, technometrics, v30, p247, doi 10.2307/1270079; nelder j.a., 1991, appl stoch model bus, v7, p107, doi doi 10.1002/asm.3150070110; pan gh, 1999, technometrics, v41, p313, doi 10.2307/1271348; satterthwaite fe, 1946, biometrics bull, v2, p110, doi 10.2307/3002019; sirvanci m. b., 1993, qual eng, v5, p611; tsui kw, 1989, j am stat assoc, v84, p602, doi 10.2307/2289949; wang pc, 1989, comput stat data an, v8, p109, doi 10.1016/0167-9473(89)90071-6; weerahandi s., 2004, gen inference repeat; wu cfj, 2009, expt planning anal o; ye kq, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p57","20","0","0","2","10","amer soc quality control-asqc","2015","43","53","11","tsai, shin-fu; liao, chen-tuo; chai, feng-shun","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"

"111","fractional brownian fields for response surface metamodeling","article","computer experiments; gaussian random fields; interpolation; intrinsic stationary; kriging; prediction intervals","kriging, a widely used metamodeling method for computer-simulation data, models the response surface as a realization of a random field. stationary covariance functions such as the gaussian, power exponential, or matern class are the most common choice for the underlying random field model. nonstationary versions of these same covariance functions with scale parameters that vary spatially are also sometimes used. fractional brownian fields (fbfs) are a different form of nonstationary random field model having stationary increments, an example of more general intrinsic stationary processes. although fbfs have been considered for intrinsic kriging in the spatial statistics literature, they have received little attention for computer-simulation response surface metamodeling. for use in the latter context, we argue that they have some attractive (as well as some unattractive) properties that mitigate certain problems inherent to many stationary covariance models, such as reversion to the mean, numerical issues due to near-singularity of covariance matrices, and difficulties in handling abrupt response surface features.","[zhang, ning; apley, daniel w.] northwestern univ, evanston, il 60208 usa","apley, dw (reprint author), northwestern univ, evanston, il 60208 usa.","ba s, 2012, ann appl stat, v6, p1838, doi 10.1214/12-aoas570; chipman h, 2012, can j stat, v40, p663, doi 10.1002/cjs.11156; christensen r, 1990, math geol, v22, p655, doi 10.1007/bf00890514; cressie n, 1990, math geol, v22, p239, doi 10.1007/bf00889887; cressie n. a. c, 1991, stat spatial data; currin c, 1991, j am stat assoc, v86, p953, doi 10.2307/2290511; currin c, 1988, ornl6498; fang kt, 2006, ch crc comp sci data, p3; fuentes m, 2008, environmetrics, v19, p487, doi 10.1002/env.891; gramacy rb, 2008, j am stat assoc, v103, p1119, doi 10.1198/016214508000000689; harville da, 1974, biometrika, v61, p383, doi 10.1093/biomet/61.2.383; huang wy, 2011, j time ser anal, v32, p364, doi 10.1111/j.1467-9892.2011.00735.x; joseph v. r., 2008, j mech design, v130; joseph vr, 2006, technometrics, v48, p458, doi 10.1198/004017006000000011; li rz, 2005, technometrics, v47, p111, doi 10.1198/004017004000000671; lindstrom t, 1993, b lond math soc, v25, p83, doi 10.1112/blms/25.1.83; mandelbrot bb, 1968, siam rev, v10, p422, doi 10.1137/1010093; matheron g., 1973, advances in applied probability, v5, p439, doi 10.2307/1425829; matheron g, 1963, econ geol, v58, p1246, doi [10.2113/gsecongeo.58.8.1246, doi 10.2113/gsecongeo.58.8.1246]; morris m. d., 1993, technometrics, v35, p41; paciorek cj, 2006, environmetrics, v17, p483, doi 10.1002/env.785; qian zg, 2006, j mech design, v128, p668, doi 10.1115/1.2179459; ranjan p, 2011, technometrics, v53, p366, doi 10.1198/tech.2011.09141; sacks j., 1989, stat sci, v4, p409, doi doi 10.1214/ss/1177012413; sampson pd, 1992, j am stat assoc, v87, p108, doi 10.2307/2290458; santner t. j., 2003, design anal computer; schmidt am, 2003, j royal stat soc b, v65, p745; staum j., 2009, p 2009 wint sim c; wackernagel h., 2003, multivariate geostat; xiong y, 2007, int j numer meth eng, v71, p733, doi 10.1002/nme.1969; zhang n., 2014, thesis nw u","31","5","5","0","5","amer soc quality control-asqc","2014","285","301","17","zhang, ning; apley, daniel w.","0.83","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","1","2","0"

"117","dimensional analysis and its applications in statistics","article","buckingham's ii theorem; design of experiment; dimensions; statistical analysis","dimensional analysis (da) is a well-developed, widely-employed methodology in the physical and engineering sciences. the application of dimensional analysis in statistics leads to three advantages: (1) the reduction of the number of potential causal factors that we need to consider, (2) the analytical insights into the relations among variables that it generates, and (3) the scalability of results. the formalization of the dimensional-analysis method in statistical design and analysis gives a clear view of its generality and overlooked significance. in this paper, we first provide general procedures for dimensional analysis prior to statistical design and analysis. we illustrate the use of dimensional analysis with three practical examples. in the first example, we demonstrate the basic dimensional-analysis process in connection with a study of factors that affect vehicle stopping distance. the second example integrates dimensional analysis into the regression analysis of the pine tree data. in our third example, we show how dimensional analysis can be used to develop a superior experimental design for the well-known paper helicopter experiment. in the regression example and in the paper helicopter experiment, we compare results obtained via the dimensional-analysis approach to those obtained via conventional approaches. from those, we demonstrate the general properties of dimensional analysis from a statistical perspective and recommend its usage based on its favorable performance.","[shen, weijie; lin, dennis k. j.] penn state univ, dept stat, university pk, pa 16802 usa; [davis, tim] we predict ltd, swansea sa1 8ph, w glam, wales; [nachtsheim, christopher j.] univ minnesota, carlson sch management, supply chain & operat dept, minneapolis, mn 55455 usa","shen, wj (reprint author), penn state univ, dept stat, university pk, pa 16802 usa.","albrecht mc, 2013, technometrics, v55, p257, doi 10.1080/00401706.2012.746207; annis dh, 2005, am stat, v59, p320, doi 10.1198/000313005x70777; asmussen e, 1955, j appl physiol, v7, p593; atkinson ac, 1994, am stat, v48, p307, doi 10.2307/2684841; box gep, 1999, j qual technol, v31, p16; box gep, 1999, j qual technol, v31, p1; bridgman p. w, 1931, dimensional anal; bruce d., 1935, forest mensuration, p226; buckingham e, 1914, phys rev, v4, p345, doi 10.1103/physrev.4.345; buckingham e., 1915, nature, v96, p396, doi 10.1038/096396d0; buckingham e., 1915, t am soc mech eng, v37, p263; davis t., 2011, communication; davis t, 2013, technometrics, v55, p271, doi 10.1080/00401706.2013.804881; finney d. j., 1977, appl stat, v26, p285; gearhart c., 2004, 2004011129 sae; islam mf, 2009, ocean eng, v36, p237, doi 10.1016/j.oceaneng.2008.11.004; johnson j. a., 2006, quality engineering, v18, p431, doi 10.1080/08982110600719415; johnson j. a., 2006, quality engineering, v18, p413, doi 10.1080/08982110600875894; lin dkj, 2013, technometrics, v55, p281, doi 10.1080/00401706.2013.804445; mason sf, 1962, hist sci; morrison s. j., 1957, applied statistics, v6, p133; piepel gf, 2013, technometrics, v55, p286, doi 10.1080/00401706.2013.778792; sonin a, 2001, phys basis dimension; stahl wr, 1962, science, v137, p205, doi 10.1126/science.137.3525.205; szirtes t, 2007, applied dimensional analysis and modeling, 2nd edition, p1; taylor m., 2007, arxivphysics07093584; vignaux ga, 1999, aust nz j stat, v41, p31","27","13","13","0","22","amer soc quality control-asqc","2014","185","198","14","shen, weijie; davis, tim; lin, dennis k. j.; nachtsheim, christopher j.","2.17","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","2","6","4","0"

the changes often occur through many different modes before converging to the final state. the proposed multimode geometric-profile monitoring method addresses three issues specific to this process, all of which have never been addressed together by existing process-monitoring methods profiling of functional data, monitoring of multimode processes, and monitoring of time-correlated processes. the new profile-monitoring method consists of two phases. in phase i, we characterize multiple modes of geometric shape changes under in-control process conditions given a sequence of geometric observations on products. we propose using a mixture of time-series models for this characterization and present an exact gibbs sampling procedure for bayesian estimation of model parameters. in phase ii, we test whether a new observation of product geometries sampled at a certain time in the current process run exhibits significant out-of-control symptoms. we propose a bayes factor score-based criteria for this testing. the proposed method is empirically verified using simulated datasets and a real dataset from a nanoparticle self-assembly process.","[park, chiwoo;

"120","data-driven cyber-vulnerability maintenance policies","article","action clarification; cyber attacks; markov-decision processes; model-uncertainty","the frequencies of cyber attacks and known cyber vulnerabilities continue to increase and there is a need for models to focus limited administrator attention and build cases for additional resources. a related challenge is the scarcity of available data partly because of security concerns. in this paper, we propose a method based on markov decision processes (mdp) for the generation and graphical evaluation of relevant maintenance policies for cases with limited data availability. the proposed method also provides an estimate of the cost benefit of collecting additional data. both bayesian and non-bayesian formulations of the transition probabilities and cost models are considered. we apply the proposed method to a real-world cyber-vulnerability dataset and generate specific guidance and cost predictions. we also illustrate the relevance of the proposed method to general mdp modeling using a numerical example involving three levels of data scarcity.","[afful-dadzie, anthony] univ ghana, sch business, legon, ghana; [allen, theodore t.] ohio state univ, columbus, oh 43210 usa","afful-dadzie, a (reprint author), univ ghana, sch business, pob lg 78, legon, ghana.","allen tt, 2011, j qual technol, v43, p224; amari sv, 2006, p rel maint s, p464; belk r., 2012, technical report; bertuccelli l., 2008, ieee am c contr; byon e, 2010, ieee t reliab, v59, p393, doi 10.1109/tr.2010.2046804; chan gk, 2006, electr pow syst res, v76, p452, doi 10.1016/j.epsr.2005.09.010; chang es, 1999, bell labs tech j, v4, p252, doi 10.1002/bltj.2202; clarke a. r., 2010, cyber war next threa; clarke a. r., 2012, ny times; cockburn e., 2009, quaestor q, v4, p1; delage e, 2010, oper res, v58, p203, doi 10.1287/opre.1080.0685; durango pl, 2002, transport res a-pol, v36, p763, doi 10.1016/s0965-8564(01)00038-6; givan r, 2000, artif intell, v122, p71, doi 10.1016/s0004-3702(00)00047-3; iyengar gn, 2005, math oper res, v30, p257, doi 10.1287/moor.1040.0129; mannor s., 2004, p 21 int c mach lear, p308; mannor s, 2007, manage sci, v53, p308, doi 10.1287/mnsc.1060.0614; mell p., 2007, cvss complete guide; montgomery d., 2012, intro stat quality c; nilim a, 2005, oper res, v53, p780, doi 10.1287/opre.1050.0216; ponemon l., 2010, 5 ann us cost data b; puterman ml, 1994, markov decision proc; tetreault j. r, 2007, p hum lang techn c, p276; white iii c. c., 1992, oper res, v42, p739; xu h., 2006, adv neural inform pr, p1537","24","7","7","1","10","amer soc quality control-asqc","2014","234","250","17","afful-dadzie, anthony; allen, theodore t.","1.17","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","2","3","0"

"123","from profile to surface monitoring: spc for cylindrical surfaces via gaussian processes","article","cylindrical surfaces; geometric specifications; gp model; kriging; profile monitoring; spatial statistics","quality of machined products is often related to the shapes of surfaces that are constrained by geometric tolerances. in this case, statistical quality monitoring should be used to quickly detect unwanted deviations from the nominal pattern. the majority of the literature has focused on statistical profile monitoring, while there is little research on surface monitoring. this paper faces the challenging task of moving from profile to surface monitoring. to this aim, different parametric approaches and control-charting procedures are presented and compared with reference to a real case study dealing with cylindrical surfaces obtained by lathe turning. in particular, a novel method presented in this paper consists of modeling the manufactured surface via gaussian processes models and monitoring the deviations of the actual surface from the target pattern estimated in phase i. regardless of the specific case study in this paper, the proposed approach is general and can be extended to deal with different kinds of surfaces or profiles.","[colosimo, bianca m.; cicorella, paolo] politecn milan, dept mech engn, i-20156 milan, italy; [pacella, massimo; blaco, marzia] univ salento, dept engn innovat, i-73100 lecce, italy","colosimo, bm (reprint author), politecn milan, dept mech engn, via masa 1, i-20156 milan, italy.","ababou r, 1994, math geol, v26, p99, doi 10.1007/bf02065878; abdel-salam ag, 2010, technical report; banerjee s, 2005, biometrics, v61, p617, doi 10.1111/j.1541-0420.2005.00320.x; champ cw, 2005, technometrics, v47, p437, doi 10.1198/004017005000000229; chenouri s, 2009, j qual technol, v41, p259; chipman ha, 2010, technometrics, v52, p280, doi 10.1198/tech.2010.09180; cho n, 2001, precis eng, v25, p35, doi 10.1016/s0141-6359(00)00053-2; colosimo b., 2011, stat anal profile mo, p217; colosimo b. m., 2010, frontiers stat quali; colosimo bm, 2008, j qual technol, v40, p1; colosimo bm, 2011, j qual technol, v43, p169; colosimo bm, 2010, int j prod res, v48, p1575, doi 10.1080/00207540802662888; colosimo bm, 2007, qual reliab eng int, v23, p707, doi 10.1002/qre.878; colosimo bm, 2011, geometric tolerances: impact on product design, quality inspection and statistical process monitoring, p1; cressie n. a. c., 1993, stat spatial data; curriero fc, 2006, math geol, v38, p907, doi 10.1007/s11004-006-9055-7; del castillo e., 2013, geodesic gauss unpub; forrester a. i. j., 2008, eng design via surro; grimshaw sd, 2013, j qual technol, v45, p130; henke rp, 1999, precis eng, v23, p273, doi 10.1016/s0141-6359(99)00023-9; higham n. j., 1996, accuracy stability n; higham nj, 2002, ima j numer anal, v22, p329, doi 10.1093/imanum/22.3.329; iso, 2012, 11012012 iso; johnson me, 1990, j stat plan infer, v26, p131, doi 10.1016/0378-3758(90)90122-b; joseph vr, 2008, stat sinica, v18, p171; kang l, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p418; kim k, 2003, j qual technol, v35, p317; mahmoud m. a., 2004, technometrics, v46, p377; matheron g, 1963, econ geol, v58, p1246, doi [10.2113/gsecongeo.58.8.1246, doi 10.2113/gsecongeo.58.8.1246]; mckay md, 1979, technometrics, v21, p239, doi 10.2307/1268522; megahed fm, 2011, j qual technol, v43, p83; montgomery d.c., 2009, intro stat quality c; morris m., 1995, j stat plan infer, v4, p381; noorossana r, 2012, stat anal profile mo; posa d, 1989, math geol, v21, p755, doi 10.1007/bf00893320; prabhu ss, 1997, j qual technol, v29, p8; qiu ph, 2010, technometrics, v52, p265, doi 10.1198/tech.2010.08188; rasmussen ce, 2010, j mach learn res, v11, p3011; rasmussen ce, 2005, adapt comput mach le, p1; rasmussen ce, 2011, gpml toolbox version; stein m., 1999, stat interpolation s; wilkinson jh, 1961, j acm, v8, p281, doi 10.1145/321075.321076; woodall wh, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p309; woodall william h., 2007, prod., v17, p420, doi 10.1590/s0103-65132007000300002; xia hf, 2008, iie trans, v40, p931, doi 10.1080/07408170801971502; zhang xd, 2005, int j prod res, v43, p25, doi 10.1080/00207540412331282060; zhang y., 2013, control charts monit","47","20","20","0","20","amer soc quality control-asqc","2014","95","113","19","colosimo, bianca m.; cicorella, paolo; pacella, massimo; blaco, marzia","3.33","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","1","6","11","0"
"124","design and evaluation of accelerated life testing plans with dual objectives","article","design of experiments; d-optimality; i-optimality; multi-objective decision analysis; reliability testing","accelerated life testing (alt) is widely used in industry to predict product lifetime and lifetime distribution. optimal test plans based on statistical optimality criteria, such as d-optimality or u-c-optimality, have recently been explored in monroe et al. (2010, 2011). however, in these studies, the product use condition was set at a constant; in reality, use stress may vary due to a changing product use environment. in this paper, we consider an i-optimality that minimizes the variance of lifetime prediction over the entire region of possible use conditions. in addition, we investigate the tradeoffs between model parameter estimation and model-based prediction for alt test plans. dual-objective optimal test plans are provided to experimenters so that they can make a decision to balance the plan's estimation and prediction properties. we employ some graphical tools, including fraction of use space (fus) plot, efficiency plot, and pareto frontier plot, to evaluate different test plans and to compare our proposed method with existing ones in literature.","[pan, rong; yang, tao] arizona state univ, tempe, az 85287 usa","pan, r (reprint author), arizona state univ, tempe, az 85287 usa.","aitkin m., 1980, applied statistics, v29, p156, doi 10.2307/2986301; collett d., 2003, modelling survival d; elsayed ea, 2002, int j mater prod tec, v17, p411, doi 10.1504/ijmpt.2002.005467; escobar la, 1995, technometrics, v37, p411, doi 10.2307/1269733; finkelstein dm, 1986, biometrics, v42, p845, doi 10.2307/2530698; finkelstein dm, 1985, biometrics, v41, p933, doi 10.2307/2530965; giovannittijensen a, 1989, technometrics, v31, p159, doi 10.2307/1268814; islam a, 1994, microelectron reliab, v34, p1459, doi 10.1016/0026-2714(94)90453-7; konak a, 2006, reliab eng syst safe, v91, p992, doi 10.1016/j.ress.2005.11.018; mccullagh p., 1989, monographs stat appl; mcgree j. m., 2009, metrika, v72, p295; meeker wq, 1975, ieee t reliab, v24, p321, doi 10.1109/tr.1975.5214922; meeker wq, 1998, wiley series probabi; monroe em, 2008, j qual technol, v40, p355; monroe em, 2011, qual reliab eng int, v27, p595, doi 10.1002/qre.1143; monroe em, 2010, j qual technol, v42, p121; myers r. h, 2009, response surface met; nelson w, 1978, technometrics, v20, p171, doi 10.2307/1268710; nelson w, 1976, technometrics, v18, p105, doi 10.2307/1267923; nelson wb, 2005, ieee t reliab, v54, p370, doi 10.1109/tr.2005.853289; nelson wb, 2005, ieee t reliab, v54, p194, doi 10.1109/tr.2005.847247; pan r., 2011, p sae 2011 world c; park jw, 1996, nav res log, v43, p863, doi 10.1002/(sici)1520-6750(199609)43:6<863::aid-nav5>3.0.co;2-2; sitter r. r., 1995, stat sinica, v5, p495; tang lc, 2002, comput ind eng, v42, p439, doi 10.1016/s0360-8352(02)00040-2; tse sk, 2008, statistics-abingdon, v42, p435, doi 10.1080/02331880801980476; yang t, 2013, ieee t reliab, v62, p527, doi 10.1109/tr.2013.2257053; zahran a, 2003, j qual technol, v35, p377","28","6","6","0","15","amer soc quality control-asqc","2014","114","126","13","pan, rong; yang, tao","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","2","2","0"

"127","assessing the capability of a manufacturing process using nonparametric bayesian density estimation","article","dirichlet distribution; normal mixture; process fallout rate; process yield","the capability of a manufacturing process refers to the ability of the process to produce items that are within set specifications. the determination of the capability of a stable manufacturing process with a multivariate quality characteristic using standard methods usually requires the assumption that the quality characteristic of interest follows a multivariate normal distribution, an assumption that is difficult to assess in practice. departures from this assumption can result in erroneous conclusions, which can be costly to the manufacturer. in this paper, we propose assessing the capability of a process using a nonparametric bayesian framework. this framework relies on using mixtures of dirichlet processes to elicit a prior on the multivariate distribution of the quality characteristic. the posterior distribution of the distribution of the quality characteristic can then be used to induce a posterior distribution on the process fallout rate, the mean distance between the quality characteristic and a specified target value, or on an associated process capability index. the methodology is demonstrated through three examples using real-world data. particular emphasis in these examples is given toward specifying the parameter values required to specify the prior distribution and on interpretation of the results.","no illinois univ, div stat, de kalb, il 60115 usa","polansky, am (reprint author), no illinois univ, div stat, de kalb, il 60115 usa.","antoniak ce, 1974, ann stat, v2, p1152, doi 10.1214/aos/1176342871; bernardo j. m., 1993, bayesian theory; bernardo jm, 1996, j r stat soc d-stat, v45, p487, doi doi 10.2307/2988547; blackwell d, 1973, ann stat, v1, p353, doi 10.1214/aos/1176342372; borges wd, 2001, qual reliab eng int, v17, p447, doi 10.1002/qre.438; bothe d, 2001, measuring process ca; chen jp, 2002, microelectron reliab, v42, p1235, doi 10.1016/s0026-2714(02)00081-1; constable g. k., 1992, asqc qual c t nashv, p37; escobar md, 1995, j am stat assoc, v90, p577, doi 10.2307/2291069; ferguson ts, 1973, ann stat, v1, p209, doi 10.1214/aos/1176342360; ferguson ts, 1974, ann stat, v2, p615, doi 10.1214/aos/1176342752; flaig jj, 1996, qual eng, v9, p205; ghosh j., 2010, bayesian nonparametr; jara a, 2011, j stat softw, v40, p1; kotz s, 2002, j qual technol, v34, p2; kotz s, 1993, process capability i; lavine m, 1992, ann stat, v20, p1222, doi 10.1214/aos/1176348767; lijoi a., 2010, bayesian nonparametr, p80; lo ay, 1984, ann stat, v12, p351, doi 10.1214/aos/1176346412; marron js, 1992, ann stat, v20, p712, doi 10.1214/aos/1176348653; montgomery d. c., 2008, intro stat quality c; nieto-barajas le, 2009, stat sinica, v19, p685; niverthi m, 2000, commun stat-simul c, v29, p667, doi 10.1080/03610910008813634; paddock s. m., 2003, stat sinica, v14, p1127; pearn wl, 2005, int j adv manuf tech, v25, p560, doi 10.1007/s00170-003-1879-4; pearn wl, 2006, ency hdb process cap; polansky a. m., 2000, technometrics, v43, p199; polansky a.m., 2002, hdb stat, v22, p625; polansky am, 1998, qual reliab eng int, v14, p43, doi 10.1002/(sici)1099-1638(199801/02)14:1<43::aid-qre146>3.3.co;2-b; shiau jjh, 1999, stat probabil lett, v45, p215, doi 10.1016/s0167-7152(99)00061-9; sommerville se, 1996, qual eng, v9, p305; spiring f, 2003, qual reliab eng int, v19, p445, doi 10.1002/qre.538; walker s. g., 2010, bayesian nonparametr, p22; wang fk, 2006, qual reliab eng int, v22, p225, doi 10.1002/qre.712; wong wh, 2010, ann stat, v38, p1433, doi 10.1214/09-aos755; yum bj, 2011, qual reliab eng int, v27, p251, doi 10.1002/qre.1115","36","2","3","1","9","amer soc quality control-asqc","2014","150","170","21","polansky, alan m.","0.33","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","0","0"
"128","batch variability in accelerated-degradation testing","article","log-normal distribution; maximum-likelihood estimation; nonlinear mixed-effects modeling; reliability; variance components estimation; weibull distribution","problem: the study that motivated this article concerns the development of a new seal to be used in a high-pressure application. a weakened seal would not only adversely affect the overall device performance but it could also lead to potential safety concerns. the seal was designed to perform for 10 years in the application environment. the development team had undertaken a temperature accelerated test to study the degradation of seal strength. the ad hoc procedure used to fit an engineering model to the data did not readily allow estimation of lower quantiles of the strength distribution and obtaining statistical confidence bounds on quantities of interest. the authors were approached for advice on statistical analysis and modeling of the data in order to guide engineering and management decision making. approach: in our initial analysis of the data, we used a standard statistical model based on the engineering relationship for seal-strength and temperature. the analysis of residuals from the maximum-likelihood fit of the model revealed an additional source of variation in the data that had not been accounted for. this finding cast doubt on the inferences that resulted from the standard statistical model due to the inadequacy of the model in representing the data. we extended the standard model to accommodate this new source of variability through nonlinear mixed effects modeling. results: the extended model was shown to adequately account for the excess source of variation in the data. the inferences based on this model showed greater uncertainty and highlighted the need to identify and mitigate the root cause of the variation. a narrow consulting question led to a significant discovery that paved the way for a meaningful engagement with the seal team. the case study shows the importance of fully understanding the experimental process and the usefulness of incisive residuals plots in statistical analysis and modeling.","[li, ming] ge global res, niskayuna, ny 12309 usa; [doganaksoy, necip] global foundries, malta, ny 12020 usa; [doganaksoy, necip] union grad coll, schenectady, ny usa","li, m (reprint author), ge global res, niskayuna, ny 12309 usa.","doganaksoy n, 2013, j qual technol, v45, p188; escobar la, 2003, math stat methods re; meeker wq, 1998, stat methods reliabi; nelson w, 1981, ieee t reliab, v30, p149, doi 10.1109/tr.1981.5221010; nelson w, 1990, accelerated testing; pinheiro j. c, 2000, mixed effects models; shi y, 2012, ieee t reliab, v61, p245, doi 10.1109/tr.2011.2170115; shi y, 2009, technometrics, v51, p1, doi 10.1198/tech.2009.0001","8","5","5","0","12","amer soc quality control-asqc","2014","171","180","10","li, ming; doganaksoy, necip","0.83","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","2","2","0"
"129","application of bayesian methods in reliability data analyses","article","accelerated test; degradation; likelihood; mcmc; openbugs; prior information","the development of the theory and application of monte carlo markov chain methods, vast improvements in computational capabilities, and emerging software alternatives have made it possible for more frequent use of bayesian methods in reliability applications. bayesian methods, however, remain controversial in reliability (and some other applications) because of the concern about from where the needed prior distributions should come. on the other hand, there are many applications where engineers have solid prior information on certain aspects of their reliability problems based on physics of failure or previous experience with the same failure mechanism. for example, engineers often have useful but imprecise knowledge about the effective activation energy in a temperature-accelerated life test or about the weibull shape parameter in the analysis of fatigue-failure data. in such applications, the use of bayesian methods is compelling, as it offers an appropriate compromise between assuming that such quantities are known and assuming that nothing is known. in this paper, we compare the use of bayesian methods with the traditional maximum-likelihood methods for a group of examples, including the analysis of field data with multiple censoring, accelerated life-test data, and accelerated degradation-test data.","[li, ming] gen elect global res ctr, appl stat lab, niskayuna, ny 12309 usa; [meeker, william q.] iowa state univ, ames, ia 50011 usa","li, m (reprint author), gen elect global res ctr, appl stat lab, niskayuna, ny 12309 usa.","abernethy rb, 1983, afwaltr832079; albert j, 2009, use r, p1, doi 10.1007/978-0-387-92298-0_1; azarkhail m., 2007, rel maint s rams 200, p214; carlin b. p., 2008, bayesian methods dat; congdon p., 2006, bayesian stat modell; dezfuli h., 2009, technical report; escobar l. a., 2003, math stat methods re; escobar la, 2006, stat sci, v21, p552, doi 10.1214/088342306000000321; garthwaite ph, 2005, j am stat assoc, v100, p680, doi 10.1198/01621450500000105; gelman a., 2013, bayesian data anal; gelman a, 2006, bayesian anal, v1, p515, doi 10.1214/06-ba117a; gilks wr, 1996, markov chain monte c; hamada m., 2005, quality engineering, v17, p615, doi 10.1080/08982110500225489; hamada ms, 2008, springer ser stat, p1; hooper jh, 1990, hdb stat methods eng; klinger dj, 1990, at t reliability man; leon rv, 2007, j qual technol, v39, p3; lunn d, 2009, stat med, v28, p3049, doi 10.1002/sim.3680; meeker wq, 1998, stat methods reliabi; meyer m. a., 1991, eliciting anal exper; o'hagan a, 1998, j roy stat soc d-sta, v47, p21; o'hagan a, 2004, reliab eng syst safe, v85, p239, doi 10.1016/j.ress.2004.03.014; olwell dh, 2001, p a rel mai, p133, doi 10.1109/rams.2001.902455; pascual f. g., 2006, hdb eng stat; plummer m., 2006, r news, v6, p7, doi doi 10.1159/000323281; r development core team, 2011, r lang env stat comp; raftery al, 1992, bayesian statistics, v4, p763; robert cp, 2004, monte carlo stat met; ross g. j. s., 1990, nonlinear estimation; smith afm, 1992, am stat, v46, p84, doi 10.2307/2684170","30","15","15","3","25","amer soc quality control-asqc","2014","1","23","23","li, ming; meeker, william q.","2.5","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","3","3","7","0","1"

(1992) has become one of the most widely used charts to monitor multivariate processes. its simplicity, combined with its high sensitivity to small and moderate process mean jumps, is at the core of its appeal. lowry et al. (1992) advocated equal smoothing of each quality variable unless there is an a priori reason to weight quality characteristics differently. however, one may have situations where differential smoothing may be justified. for instance: (a) departures in process mean may be different across quality variables, (b) some variables may evolve over time at a much different pace than other variables, and (c) the level of correlation between variables could vary substantially. here, we assess the performance of the differentially smoothed mewma chart. the case of two quality variables (bewma) is discussed in detail. a bivariate markov-chain method that uses conditional distributions is developed for average run-length (arl) calculations. the proposed chart is shown to perform at least as well as lowry et al. (1992)'5 chart and noticeably better in many mean-jump directions. comparisons with the recently introduced doubles-moothed bewma chart and the use of univariate charts for the independent case show that the proposed differentially smoothed bewma chart has superior performance.","[huh, ick; viveros-aguilera, roman; balakrishnan, narayanaswamy] mcmaster univ, dept math & stat, hamilton, on l8s 4k1, canada","huh, i (reprint author), mcmaster univ, dept math & stat, hamilton, on l8s 4k1, canada.","alkahtani s, 2012, commun stat-simul c, v41, p238, doi 10.1080/03610918.2011.585004; crosier rb, 1988, technometrics, v30, p291, doi 10.2307/1270083; hawkins dm, 2007, j qual technol, v39, p118; lowry c., 1992, technometrics, v34, p34; lucas jm, 1990, technometrics, v32, p1, doi 10.2307/1269835; mahmoud ma, 2010, commun stat-simul c, v39, p933, doi 10.1080/03610911003663907; montgomery d. c., 2008, intro stat quality c; pignatiello jj, 1990, j qual technol, v22, p173; prabhu ss, 1997, j qual technol, v29, p8; rigdon se, 1995, j stat comput sim, v52, p351, doi 10.1080/00949659508811685; rigdon se, 1995, stat probabil lett, v24, p365, doi 10.1016/0167-7152(94)00196-f; runger gc, 1996, j am stat assoc, v91, p1701, doi 10.2307/2291599; shamma se, 1991, commun stat simulat, v20, p511, doi 10.1080/03610919108812969; shamma se, 1992, int j quality reliab, v9, p18; woodall wh, 1985, technometrics, v27, p285, doi 10.2307/1269710; woodall wh, 2005, technometrics, v47, p425, doi 10.1198/004017005000000256; yumin l., 1996, comput ind eng, v31, p779; zhang l, 2005, qual technol quant m, v2, p39, doi doi 10.1080/16843703.2005.11673088","18","2","2","0","6","amer soc quality control-asqc","2013","377","393","17","huh, ick; viveros-aguilera, roman; balakrishnan, narayanaswamy","0.29","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","0","0"

"141","the effect of aggregating data when monitoring a poisson process","article","data aggregation; exponential cusum chart; poisson cusum chart; public health; safety","the aggregation of event counts is a common, and often necessary, practice in many applications. when working with large numbers of events, it may be more practical to consider the number of events occurring during time intervals of a given length rather than the individual interarrival times between successive events. however, when data collection or summarization is done only at the end of aggregation periods, e.g., days, weeks, months, or quarters, there is the potential for significant information loss. in public-health and safety applications, this data lag could lead to unnecessary injuries and deaths because of a delay in detecting an increased risk. in our paper, we assume an underlying poisson process and study the effect of aggregation by investigating the relative performance of the cumulative sum (cusum) control chart for monitoring with poisson-distributed aggregated data and the cusum chart based on exponentially distributed time-between-events data. by comparing steady-state chart performance for varying aggregation periods, we show that the adverse effect of aggregation can be significant.","[schuh, anna; woodall, william h.; camelio, jaime a.] virginia tech, blacksburg, va 24061 usa","schuh, a (reprint author), virginia tech, blacksburg, va 24061 usa.","benneyan jc, 1998, infect cont hosp ep, v19, p265; benneyan jc, 1998, infect cont hosp ep, v19, p194; bls (bureau of labor statistics), 2013, inj illn fat; borror cm, 1998, j qual technol, v30, p352; burkom howard s, 2004, mmwr suppl, v53, p67; dubrawski a., 2011, biosurveilance metho; gan ff, 1994, j qual technol, v26, p109; han sw, 2009, quality reliability, v26, p279; lucas jm, 1985, technometrics, v27, p129, doi 10.2307/1268761; montgomery d. c., 2008, intro stat quality c; occupational safety and health administration (osha), 2013, workpl inj illn fat; page es, 1954, biometrika, v41, p100, doi 10.2307/2333009; reynolds mr, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p343; reynolds mr, 2004, technometrics, v46, p200, doi 10.1198/004017004000000257; reynolds mr, 1999, j qual technol, v31, p87; reynolds mr, 2000, iie trans, v32, p515, doi 10.1023/a:1007671903559; schuh a., 2013, int j inj c in press; steiner sh, 2010, stat med, v29, p444, doi 10.1002/sim.3788; szarka jl, 2012, j qual technol, v44, p54; szarka jl, 2011, qual reliab eng int, v27, p735, doi 10.1002/qre.1256; white ch, 1997, qual eng, v9, p673, doi doi 10.1080/08982119708919089; wu z, 2010, qual reliab eng int, v26, p541, doi 10.1002/qre.1076","22","12","13","2","10","amer soc quality control-asqc","2013","260","272","13","schuh, anna; woodall, william h.; camelio, jaime a.","1.71","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","4","2","4","1","0"

"144","definitive screening designs with added two-level categorical factors","article","alias; conference matrix; confounding; coordinate exchange algorithm; d-efficiency; robust designs; screening designs","recently, jones and nachtsheim (2011) proposed a new class of designs called definitive screening designs (dsds). these designs have three levels, provide estimates of main effects that are unbiased by any second-order effect, require only one more than twice as many runs as there are factors, and avoid confounding of any pair of second-order effects. for designs having six factors or more, these designs project to efficient response surface designs with three or fewer factors. a limitation of these designs is that all factors must be quantitative. in this paper, we develop column-augmented dsds that can accommodate any number of two-level qualitative factors using two methods. the dsd-augment method provides highly efficient designs that are still definitive in the sense that the estimates of all main effects continue to be unbiased by any active second-order effects. an alternative procedure, the orth-augment approach, leads to designs that are orthogonal linear main effects plans; however, some partial aliasing between main effects and interactions involving the categorical factors is present.","[jones, bradley] sas inst, cary, nc 27513 usa; [nachtsheim, christopher j.] univ minnesota, carlson sch management, supply chain & operat dept, minneapolis, mn 55455 usa","jones, b (reprint author), sas inst, cary, nc 27513 usa.","box gep, 1961, technometrics, v3, p449, doi 10.2307/1266553; hedayat as, 1999, orthogonal arrays th; jones b, 2011, j qual technol, v43, p1; meyer rk, 1995, technometrics, v37, p60, doi 10.2307/1269153; nguyen nk, 1996, technometrics, v38, p279, doi 10.2307/1270612; wang jc, 1992, technometrics, v34, p409; xiao l., 2012, j qual technol, v44, p1; xu hq, 2002, technometrics, v44, p356, doi 10.1198/004017002188618554","8","28","29","0","18","amer soc quality control-asqc","2013","121","129","9","jones, bradley; nachtsheim, christopher j.","4","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","5","4","8","7","3"

"146","a multivariate sign chart for monitoring process shape parameters","article","distribution-free; multivariate covariance matrix; non parametric procedure; robustness; statistical process control","this paper develops a new multivariate nonparametric statistical process control (spc) control chart for monitoring shape parameters, which is based on integrating a powerful multivariate spatial-sign test and exponentially weighted moving average (ewma) control scheme to on-line sequential monitoring. it has a strictly distribution-free property over a broad class of population models, which implies the in-control run-length distribution can attain or is always very close to the nominal one when using the same control limit designed for the multivariate normal distribution. this proposed control chart possesses some other positive features: its computation speed is fast with a similar computation effort to the parametric multivariate ewma (mewma) counterpart; it is easy to implement because only the multivariate median and the associated transformation matrix need to be estimated from the historical data before monitoring; it is efficient in detecting small or moderate shifts, when the process distribution is heavy tailed or skewed; it is also able to handle the case when the sample size is one and is effective in downward shifts. simulation comparisons and a real-data example from a white-wine production process show that it performs quite well in applications.","[li, zhonghua;

"147","optimal blocking for general resolution-3 designs","article","aliasing; confounding; generalized word-length pattern; orthogonal array; strength 2","this paper presents a general method for finding optimal blocking arrangements of pure-level and mixed-level orthogonal designs of resolution 3. the method requires enumeration of all nonisomorphic 'full designs' that include the treatment factors as well as the blocking factor. for all these designs, generalized word counts expressing the aliasing between main effects and two-factor interactions as well as the aliasing among two-factor interactions are calculated. the same is done for all projections into treatment designs obtained by dropping any possible blocking factor. the generalized word counts of the full design and treatment designs then allow the selection of blocking arrangements that are optimal with respect to five criteria appropriate for blocking resolution-3 orthogonal designs. we provide optimal blocking arrangements for orthogonal pure-level and mixed-level designs of 12, 16, 18, 20, and 27 runs.","[schoen, eric d.] tno, nl-3700 aj zeist, netherlands; [schoen, eric d.; sartono, bagus; goos, peter] univ antwerp, fac appl econ, antwerp, belgium; [sartono, bagus] bogor agr univ, bogor, indonesia; [goos, peter] univ antwerp, statua ctr stat, antwerp, belgium; [goos, peter] erasmus univ, erasmus sch econ, rotterdam, netherlands","schoen, ed (reprint author), tno, nl-3700 aj zeist, netherlands.","ai m., 2004, canad j stat, v32, p57; bisgaard s, 1994, technometrics, v36, p308, doi 10.2307/1269375; box g. e., 2005, stat expt; cheng sw, 2004, ann stat, v32, p2168, doi 10.1214/009053604000000599; cheng sw, 2004, technometrics, v46, p269, doi 10.1198/004017004000000301; cheng sw, 2002, technometrics, v44, p269, doi 10.1198/004017002188618455; connor w.s., 1959, appl math series, v54; deng ly, 1999, stat sinica, v9, p1071; deng ly, 2002, technometrics, v44, p173, doi 10.1198/004017002317375127; fries a, 1980, technometrics, v22, p601, doi 10.2307/1268198; hedayat a, 1999, orthogonal anal theo; lam c, 1996, j stat plan infer, v56, p187, doi 10.1016/s0378-3758(96)00018-3; national bureau of standards, 1957, appl math series, v48; rao c. r, 1947, jr statist soc     s, v9, p128; schoen ed, 2010, j comb des, v18, p123, doi 10.1002/jcd.20236; schoen ed, 2009, qual reliab eng int, v25, p467, doi 10.1002/qre.986; sitter rr, 1997, technometrics, v39, p382, doi 10.2307/1271502; sun dx, 1997, technometrics, v39, p298, doi 10.2307/1271134; tang bx, 1999, ann stat, v27, p1914; wang jc, 1992, technometrics, v34, p409; wu c. f. j., 2009, expt planning anal p; xu h., 2001, ann stat, v23, p1066; xu hq, 2004, technometrics, v46, p280, doi 10.1198/004017004000000310","23","4","4","0","4","amer soc quality control-asqc","2013","166","187","22","schoen, eric d.; sartono, bagus; goos, peter","0.57","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","0","1","1","0"

"149","integrating analytical models with finite-element models: an application in micromachining","article","computer experiment; engineering model; gaussian process model; metamodel; sensitivity analysis; two-stage design","problem: the prediction of cutting forces is very important in designing mechanical micromachining to ensure geometrical accuracy of the machined feature and avoid tool breakage. these predictions can be done either via analytical models or finite-element models. the finite-element models are precise but usually time consuming to run. analytical models, on the other hand, are less accurate but computationally much cheaper. the problem here is to integrate these two types of physics-based models and obtain an easy-to-evaluate statistical model that can approximate the machining forces. approach: we propose performing a sensitivity analysis using the computationally cheap analytical models prior to conducting the computationally intensive finite-element simulations. with the elicited prior knowledge from the sensitivity analysis, a two-stage strategy is presented for designing the finite-element simulations in which customized number of levels can be assigned for each input factor. the finite-element simulation data can then be integrated with the analytical models in developing the final metamodel. results: we show that the initial sensitivity analysis can reveal critical information about the underlying system and guide us to more efficiently extract information from the finite-element models. the proposed design for the finite-element simulations is comprised of two subarrays and overall can achieve desirable orthogonality and space-filling properties. compared with using n different levels for all input factors, as in the traditional space-filling design, the new design is more capable for estimating factor interactions while still maintaining the ability to capture necessary nonlinear effects. by using fewer levels, it can also improve the efficiency of estimating the effects when the simulation is subject to stochastic noise. in model validation, our numerical results indicate that the fitted integrated metamodel can more precisely approximate the machining forces than either using the analytical models or the traditional metamodel based on the finite-element simulations alone.","[ba, shan] portland state univ, fariborz maseeh dept math & stat, portland, or 97201 usa; [jain, nikhil; singh, ramesh] indian inst technol, dept mech engn, bombay 400076, maharashtra, india; [joseph, v. roshan] georgia inst technol, h milton stewart sch ind & syst engn, atlanta, ga 30332 usa","ba, s (reprint author), portland state univ, fariborz maseeh dept math & stat, portland, or 97201 usa.","arrazola p j, 2008, international journal of machining and machinability of materials, v4, p14, doi 10.1504/ijmmm.2008.020907; ba s, 2011, j am stat assoc, v106, p1139, doi 10.1198/jasa.2011.tm10229; bingham d, 2009, biometrika, v96, p51, doi 10.1093/biomet/asn057; challen jm, 1984, int j mech sci, v26, p403, doi 10.1016/0020-7403(84)90030-4; fang kt, 2006, ch crc comp sci data, p3; fang kt, 2000, biometrika, v87, p193, doi 10.1093/biomet/87.1.193; hedayat a. s., 1999, orthogonal arrays; johnson me, 1990, j stat plan infer, v26, p131, doi 10.1016/0378-3758(90)90122-b; joseph vr, 2008, stat sinica, v18, p171; joseph vr, 2006, technometrics, v48, p458, doi 10.1198/004017006000000011; kennedy mc, 2000, biometrika, v87, p1, doi 10.1093/biomet/87.1.1; kerr mk, 2001, stat sinica, v11, p605; manjunathaiah j, 2000, j manuf sci e-t asme, v122, p384, doi 10.1115/1.1285886; mckay md, 1979, technometrics, v21, p239, doi 10.2307/1268522; merchant m.e., 1944, journal of applied mechanics, v11, pa168; morris md, 1995, j stat plan infer, v43, p381, doi 10.1016/0378-3758(94)00035-t; outeiro jc, 2006, int j mach tool manu, v46, p1786, doi 10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2005.11.013; qian pzg, 2008, technometrics, v50, p192, doi 10.1198/004017008000000082; qian pzg, 2009, biometrika, v96, p957, doi 10.1093/biomet/asp045; qian pzg, 2009, ann stat, v37, p3616, doi 10.1214/09-aos690; qian pzg, 2009, stat sinica, v19, p287; qian pzg, 2006, j mech design, v128, p668; sacks j., 1989, stat sci, v4, p409, doi doi 10.1214/ss/1177012413; saltelli a., 2000, sensitivity anal; santner t. j., 2003, design anal computer; singh r., 2009, asme j manufacturing, v131; tuo r., 2013, technometri in press; waldorf dj, 1998, j manuf sci e-t asme, v120, p693, doi 10.1115/1.2830208; wu cfj, 2009, expt planning anal o; xia hf, 2011, iie trans, v43, p242, doi 10.1080/0740817x.2010.521804; yan h, 2007, mater design, v28, p272, doi 10.1016/j.matdes.2005.06.017","31","3","3","0","6","amer soc quality control-asqc","2013","200","212","13","ba, shan; jain, nikhil; joseph, v. roshan; singh, ramesh","0.43","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","2","0"

"156","adaptive generalized likelihood ratio control charts for detecting unknown patterned mean shifts","article","control charts; dynamic shifts; generalized likelihood ratio test; nonparametric; post-signal diagnostic; statistical process control; wavelet smoothing","traditional statistical control schemes have been mainly focused on detecting constant mean shifts. in many practical applications, however, the mean of the observed sequence can exhibit a time-varying behavior after the fault occurrence. shewhart control charts supplemented with sensitizing run rules have been suggested for detecting nonrandom dynamic mean patterns. however, the choice of a particular set of run rules requires some prior knowledge of the possible expected patterns. in addition, the resulting schemes can have poor performance against small shifts. when the mean shift pattern is known in advance, generalized likelihood ratio (glr), cumulative score (cuscore), and optimal general linear filter (oglf) control charts have also been proposed for change-point detection. further, some adaptive cuscore schemes have been recently developed for detecting an unknown patterned mean shift. however, these adaptive cuscores assume the occurrence of one-sided mean shifts. hence, their performance may be poor in the case of an oscillatory behavior of the process mean. to overcome these limitations, we propose estimating a possible pattern in the mean using an exponentially weighted moving average (ewma), which is especially effective with one-sided shifts in the mean, combined with a wavelet smoother, which is effective in estimating oscillatory mean patterns. the two estimates then drive two separate conventional glr tests for significance. a control chart is proposed for observations from normal distributions and then extended to a completely distribution-free setting. extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed charts with a wide variety of patterned mean shifts in both the independent and autocorrelated scenarios and with a wide variety of distributions. in addition, the proposed scheme provides post-signal diagnostic information that estimates the change-point location and the shift pattern of the mean. an r package is available online as supplementary material.","[capizzi, giovanna;

"157","a bayesian approach to the analysis of split-plot combined and product arrays and optimization in robust parameter design","article","bayesian predictive density; generalized linear mixed models; hard-to-change factor; markov chain monte carlo; process optimization; response surface; restricted randomization","many robust parameter design (rpd) studies involve a split-plot randomization structure and it is essential to account for the induced correlation structure to obtain valid inferences in the analysis. bayesian methods are appealing for these studies because they naturally accommodate a general class of models, can account for parameter uncertainty in process optimization, and offer the necessary flexibility when one is interested in nonstandard performance criteria, e.g., the probability that a new response exceeds some threshold value. in this paper, we present a bayesian approach to process optimization for a general class of rpd models, including both normal and non-normal responses, in the split-plot context using an empirical approximation of the posterior distribution for an objective function of interest. two examples from the literature, one involving a crossed array and the other a combined array, are used for illustration.","[robinson, timothy j.] univ wyoming, dept stat, laramie, wy 82071 usa; [pintar, adam l.] nist, stat engn div, informat technol lab, gaithersburg, md 20899 usa; [anderson-cook, christine m.; hamada, michael s.] los alamos natl lab, stat sci grp, los alamos, nm 87545 usa","robinson, tj (reprint author), univ wyoming, dept stat, laramie, wy 82071 usa.","allen tt, 2011, j qual technol, v43, p224; apley dw, 2011, iie trans, v43, p471, doi 10.1080/0740817x.2010.532854; box gep, 1992, j applied statistics, v19, p3; casella g, 1992, am stat, v46, p167, doi 10.2307/2685208; chib s, 1995, am stat, v49, p327, doi 10.2307/2684568; chipman h, 1998, j qual technol, v30, p11; degroot mh, 1970, optimal stat decisio; engel j, 1996, qual reliab eng int, v12, p95; ganju j, 1997, commun stat-theor m, v26, p47, doi 10.1080/03610929708831901; gelfand ae, 1990, j am stat assoc, v85, p398, doi 10.2307/2289776; gelman a., 2004, bayesian data anal; gelman a, 2006, bayesian anal, v1, p515, doi 10.1214/06-ba117a; gilmour sg, 2009, j r stat soc c-appl, v58, p467, doi 10.1111/j.1467-9876.2009.00662.x; goos p, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p162; johnson ve, 2004, ann stat, v32, p2361, doi 10.1214/009053604000000616; kim jr, 2002, thesis texas a m u; lee y, 2003, j qual technol, v35, p2; lee y., 2010, appl stoch model bus, v27, p315; leon rv, 1987, technometrics, v29, p253, doi 10.2307/1269331; mccullagh p, 1989, gen linear models; miro-quesada g, 2004, j appl stat, v31, p251, doi 10.1080/0266476042000184019; myers wr, 2005, j qual technol, v37, p130; rajagopal r, 2005, j qual technol, v37, p210; robinson tj, 2009, technometrics, v51, p56, doi 10.1198/tech.2009.0006; robinson tj, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p180; robinson tj, 2004, qual reliab eng int, v20, p81, doi 10.1002/qre.602; sahni ns, 2009, j qual technol, v41, p181; spiegelhalter d., 2004, winbugs version 1 4; vining gg, 2005, j qual technol, v37, p115; wolfinger rd, 1998, technometrics, v40, p62, doi 10.2307/1271393","30","2","2","1","6","amer soc quality control-asqc","2012","304","320","17","robinson, timothy j.; pintar, adam l.; anderson-cook, christine m.; hamada, michael s.","0.25","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","0"

"160","an algorithm for finding d-efficient equivalent-estimation second-order split-plot designs","article","coordinate-exchange algorithm; d-optimality; equivalent estimation; generalized least squares; ordinary least squares; restricted maximum likelihood estimation (reml); split-plot design","many industrial experiments involve restricted rather than complete randomization. this often leads to the use of split-plot designs, which limit the number of independent settings of some of the experimental factors. these factors, named whole-plot factors, are often, in some way, hard to change. the remaining factors, called subplot factors, are easier to change. their levels are therefore independently reset for every run of the experiment. in general, model estimation from data from split-plot experiments requires the use of generalized least squares (gls). however, for some split-plot designs, the ordinary least squares (ols) estimator will produce the same factor-effect estimates as the gls estimator. these designs are called equivalent-estimation split-plot designs and offer the advantage that estimation of the factor effects does not require estimation of the variance components in the split-plot model. while many of the equivalent-estimation second-order response-surface designs presented in the literature do not perform well in terms of estimation efficiency (as measured by the d-optimality criterion), macharia and goos (2010) showed that, in many instances, it is possible to generate second-order equivalent-estimation split-plot designs that are highly efficient and, hence, provide precise factor-effect estimates. in this work, we present an algorithm that allows us to (i) identify equivalent-estimation designs for scenarios where macharia and goos (2010) did not find equivalent-estimation designs and (ii) find equivalent-estimation designs that outperform those of macharia and goos (2010) in terms of the d-optimality criterion. we also study the performance of equivalent-estimation designs when it comes to estimating the variance components in the split-plot model and observe that they outperform d-optimal designs in this respect.","[jones, bradley] sas inst, cary, nc 27513 usa; [jones, bradley; goos, peter] univ antwerp, fac appl econ, b-2000 antwerp, belgium; [jones, bradley; goos, peter] univ antwerp, statua ctr stat, b-2000 antwerp, belgium; [goos, peter] erasmus univ, erasmus sch econ, nl-3000 dr rotterdam, netherlands","jones, b (reprint author), sas inst, sas campus dr, cary, nc 27513 usa.","almini aa, 2009, j qual technol, v41, p272; bingham d, 1999, technometrics, v41, p62, doi 10.2307/1270995; bingham dr, 2004, j r stat soc c-appl, v53, p325, doi 10.1046/j.1467-9876.2003.05029.x; brent r p, 1973, algorithms minimizat; gilmour sg, 2009, j r stat soc c-appl, v58, p467, doi 10.1111/j.1467-9876.2009.00662.x; goos p, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p162; goos p, 2003, technometrics, v45, p235, doi 10.1198/004017003000000050; goos p, 2001, j qual technol, v33, p436; goos p, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p12; goos p., 2011, design expt case stu; goos p, 2006, stat neerl, v60, p361, doi 10.1111/j.1467-9574.2006.00333.x; huang p, 1998, technometrics, v40, p314, doi 10.2307/1270532; jones b, 2007, j roy stat soc c-app, v56, p347, doi 10.1111/j.1467-9876.2007.00581.x; jones b, 2012, j qual technol, v44, p85; jones b, 2011, technometrics, v53, p62, doi 10.1198/tech.2010.09113; jones b, 2009, biometrika, v96, p67, doi 10.1093/biomet/asn070; kulahci m, 2005, technometrics, v47, p495, doi 10.1198/004017005000000427; letsinger jd, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p381; macharia h, 2010, j qual technol, v42, p358; mcelroy fw, 1967, j am stat assoc, v62, p1302, doi 10.2307/2283779; parker pa, 2006, qual reliab eng int, v22, p291, doi 10.1002/qre.771; parker pa, 2007, j qual technol, v39, p376; parker pa, 2007, technometrics, v49, p56, doi 10.1198/004017006000000462; rodriguez m, 2010, j qual technol, v42, p1; schoen e, 2011, j qual technol, v43, p66; searle s. r., 1992, variance component e; trinca la, 2001, technometrics, v43, p25, doi 10.1198/00401700152404291; vining gg, 2008, j qual technol, v40, p394; vining gg, 2005, j qual technol, v37, p115","29","10","10","0","4","amer soc quality control-asqc","2012","363","374","12","jones, bradley; goos, peter","1.25","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","4","0","3","1","0"

"162","assessing a binary measurement system with varying misclassification rates using a latent class random effects model","article","beta binomial; binary measurement systems; latent class model; misclassification rates; random effects","when no gold standard measurement system is available, we can assess a binary measurement system by making repeated measurements on a random sample of parts and then using a latent class model for the analysis. however, there is widespread criticism of the model assumptions that, given the true state of the part, the repeated measurements are independent and have the same misclassification probability. we propose a latent class random effects model that relaxes these assumptions by modeling the distribution of the two misclassification rates with beta distributions. we start by finding the likelihood, the maximum likelihood estimates (mles) and their approximate standard deviations with the standard assessment plan that selects parts at random from the process. however, to estimate the model parameters with reasonable precision, the standard plan requires extremely large sample sizes in the common industrial situation where the proportion of conforming parts is high and the misclassification probabilities are small. more realistic sample sizes are possible when we instead sample randomly from the population of previously failed parts and supplement the likelihood with baseline information on the overall pass rate. we show using simulation that, for feasible designs, the asymptotic standard deviation based on the expected information provides a reasonably close approximation to the simulated standard deviation. we then use these approximations to investigate how the properties of the mles for the unknown parameters depend on the baseline size, the number of parts in the sample, and the number of repeated measurements per part.","[danila, oana; steiner, stefan h.; mackay, r. jock] univ waterloo, dept stat & actuarial sci, waterloo, on n2l 3g1, canada","danila, o (reprint author), univ waterloo, dept stat & actuarial sci, waterloo, on n2l 3g1, canada.","[anonymous], 2009, maple 13; beavers dp, 2011, j qual technol, v43, p16; boyles ra, 2001, technometrics, v43, p223, doi 10.1198/004017001750386332; burke jr, 1995, qual eng, v7, p543; danila o., 2011, technometrics unpub; danila o, 2008, j qual technol, v40, p310; danila o, 2010, j qual technol, v42, p152; de mast j, 2011, j qual technol, v43, p99; dendukuri n, 2001, biometrics, v57, p158, doi 10.1111/j.0006-341x.2001.00158.x; farnum nicholas r., 1994, modern stat quality; fujisawa h, 2000, biometrics, v56, p706, doi 10.1111/j.0006-341x.2000.00706.x; johnson n. l., 1994, continuous univariat, v1; *mathworks inc, 2008, matlab 7 7 0; montgomery d. c., 1996, intro stat quality c; nelder ja, 1965, comput j, v7, p308, doi 10.1093/comjnl/7.4.308; pepe m. s, 2003, stat evaluation med; qu ys, 1996, biometrics, v52, p797, doi 10.2307/2533043; quinino rdc, 2005, comput ind eng, v49, p591, doi 10.1016/j.cie.2005.07.006; vacek p., 1983, biometrics, v41, p959; van wieringen w. n., 2005, quality engineering, v17, p495, doi 10.1080/08982110500225562; van wieringen wn, 2008, technometrics, v50, p468, doi 10.1198/004017008000000415; walter sd, 1988, j clin epidemiol, v41, p923, doi 10.1016/0895-4356(88)90110-2","22","10","10","1","15","amer soc quality control-asqc","2012","179","191","13","danila, oana; steiner, stefan h.; mackay, r. jock","1.25","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","3","0","3","2","0","1"

"167","robust leak tests for transmission systems using nonlinear mixed-effect models","article","control charts; nonlinear profiles; parametric nonlinear regression; powertrain manufacturing; random effects","problem: leakage of the transmission fluid or oil in powertrain systems (i.e., transmissions, cylinder heads, engine blocks, etc.) can cause engine overheating and/or permanent damage. therefore, it is crucial to run a leak test to inspect for any possible porosity in the casting parts. however, the inspection results for the amount of leakage at given testing times are sensitive to the tested part's temperature, which varies from part to part but was not previously incorporated in the leak testing systems. the objective of this paper is to develop a robust leak testing system that is insensitive to the part temperature variations in real production processes. approach: in the production line, a part is tested at a temperature that is generally not equal to the calibration temperature at which the inspection threshold for leakage was set. to achieve a robust leak test that is insensitive to temperature variation in the tested part, we propose a temperature compensation algorithm to adjust the measured leak flow, taking into account the tested part temperature and the calibration temperature. for this purpose, a nonlinear mixed-effect model is first developed for modeling the leak flow profile as a function of both the leak testing time and the part temperature. then, the fitted mixed-effect model is used to adjust the leak flow based on the calibration temperature. if the amount of the adjusted leakage at the given inspection time exceeds the inspection threshold, the part is rejected; otherwise, the part is accepted. results: the proposed compensation algorithm is developed and validated using a set of training samples and another set of test samples, respectively. we use the percentage of error reduction in the leak flow measurements at different temperatures as the criterion to validate the developed compensation algorithm. the results show that the average percentage of error reduction for the test samples is about 92%. this indicates a significant improvement in the leak testing results.","[paynabar, kamran] georgia inst technol, atlanta, ga 30332 usa; [jin, jionghua (judy)] univ michigan, dept ind & operat engn, ann arbor, mi 48109 usa; [agapiou, john] gen motors r&d, warren, mi 48090 usa; [deeds, paula] gen motor powertrain, pontiac, mi 48340 usa","paynabar, k (reprint author), georgia inst technol, atlanta, ga 30332 usa.","akaike h, 1974, ieee t automat contr, vac19, p716, doi 10.1109/tac.1974.1100705; davidian m, 1995, nonlinear models rep; demidenko e., 2004, mixed models theory; ding y, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p199; franklin g. f., 2006, feedback control dyn; holmes ds, 1993, qual eng, v5, p619, doi doi 10.1080/08982119308919004; jensen wa, 2009, j qual technol, v41, p18; jin jh, 2000, j manuf sci e-t asme, v122, p360, doi 10.1115/1.538926; mosesova s. a., 2006, rr0606 u wat; paynabar k, 2011, iie trans, v43, p275, doi 10.1080/0740817x.2010.521807; pinheiro j. c, 2000, mixed effects models; sagi n.h., 1999, u.s. patent, patent no.

"168","i-optimal versus d-optimal split-plot response surface designs","article","coordinate-exchange algorithm; d-optimality; hard-to-change factors; i-optimality; iv-optimality; multistratum design; split-plot design; v-optimality","response surface experiments often involve only quantitative factors, and the response is fit using a full quadratic model in these factors. the term response surface implies that interest in these studies is more on prediction than parameter estimation because the points on the fitted surface are predicted responses. when computing optimal designs for response surface experiments, it therefore makes sense to focus attention on the predictive capability of the designs. however, the most popular criterion for creating optimal experimental designs is the d-optimality criterion, which aims to minimize the variance of the factor effect estimates in an omnibus sense. because i-optimal designs minimize the average variance of prediction over the region of experimentation, their focus is clearly on prediction. therefore, the i-optimality criterion seems to be a more appropriate one than the d-optimality criterion for generating response surface designs. here we introduce i-optimal design of split-plot response surface experiments. we show through several examples that i-optimal split-plot designs provide substantial benefits in terms of improved prediction compared with d-optimal split-plot designs, while also performing very well in terms of the precision of the factor effect estimates.","[jones, bradley; goos, peter] univ antwerp, fac appl econ, antwerp, belgium; [goos, peter] erasmus univ, erasmus sch econ, rotterdam, netherlands",NA,"almimi aa, 2008, j qual technol, v40, p154; anbari ft, 2008, j qual technol, v40, p31; arnouts h, 2010, comput stat data an, v54, p3381, doi 10.1016/j.csda.2009.11.014; bingham d, 1999, technometrics, v41, p62, doi 10.2307/1270995; bingham d.r., 2004, j royal stat soc c, v54, p955; bingham dr, 2004, j r stat soc c-appl, v53, p325, doi 10.1046/j.1467-9876.2003.05029.x; goos p, 2003, technometrics, v45, p235, doi 10.1198/004017003000000050; goos p, 2001, j qual technol, v33, p436; goos p, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p12; goos p., 2011, optimal design expt; goos p, 2002, optimal design block; goos p, 2006, stat neerl, v60, p361, doi 10.1111/j.1467-9574.2006.00333.x; goos p, 2009, technometrics, v51, p96, doi 10.1198/tech.2009.0010; haines lm, 1987, technometrics, v29, p439; hardin r. h., 1991, computer generated m; hardin rh, 1993, j stat plan infer, v37, p339, doi 10.1016/0378-3758(93)90112-j; huang p, 1998, technometrics, v40, p314, doi 10.2307/1270532; jones b, 2007, j roy stat soc c-app, v56, p347, doi 10.1111/j.1467-9876.2007.00581.x; jones b, 2009, j qual technol, v41, p340; kulahci m, 2005, technometrics, v47, p495, doi 10.1198/004017005000000427; letsinger jd, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p381; macharia h, 2010, j qual technol, v42, p358; mcleod rg, 2008, j qual technol, v40, p227; meyer rk, 1995, technometrics, v37, p60, doi 10.2307/1269153; meyer rk, 1988, am j math management, v3, p329; montgomery d. c., 1991, design anal expt; parker pa, 2006, qual reliab eng int, v22, p291, doi 10.1002/qre.771; parker pa, 2007, j qual technol, v39, p376; parker pa, 2007, technometrics, v49, p56, doi 10.1198/004017006000000462; rodriguez m, 2010, j qual technol, v42, p1; schoen e, 2011, j qual technol, v43, p66; trinca la, 2001, technometrics, v43, p25, doi 10.1198/00401700152404291; vining gg, 2005, j qual technol, v37, p115","33","25","26","1","13","amer soc quality control-asqc","2012","85","101","17","jones, bradley; goos, peter","3.13","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","0","1","6","2","6","8","0"

"173","semiconductor contamination: eliciting a physical model through factorial experimentation","article","intrinsically linear functions; least-squares parameter estimation; nonreplicated experiments; physical models; pseudo error; response surface analysis; semiconductor contamination; three-level factorial experiments","problem: in semiconductor manufacturing of integrated circuits, the transfer of metallic contaminants onto the silicon wafers can be a problem. an understanding of this contamination process, particularly for copper from cleaning solutions onto a wafer surface, is important in assessing the need for purer solutions and cleaner processing systems. these issues will grow in importance as technology advances and chip sizes become increasingly larger. this paper describes our development of a physical deposition model for copper from a cleaning solution onto a wafer surface approach: we focus on the planning, design, and analysis of a three-factor, three-level factorial experiment to explore a mechanistic or physical model for a deposition mechanism, and evaluate the efficacy of this model. we postulated this model based on the results of two, two-level, highly fractionated experiments in which we acquired basic measurement knowledge, established which contaminants transfer onto the wafers, and fit an empirical transfer model. during the course of our research, we traversed three stages in acquiring knowledge through experimentation, delineated by box and draper (2007) as screening (which?), empirical (how?), and mechanistic (why?). the theory underlying this model is described in the section titled process description and introduction. see the supplement at http://www.asq.org/pub/jqt/ for a more detailed explanation of the theory. results: we develop a physical model for the deposition of copper from a solution onto a wafer given by the following prediction equation: (cu) over cap water = 8.7 . 10(16) cu-soln . t . exp{-1/30}, (1) where cu-wafer is the density of the copper deposition on the wafer surface in atoms per square centimeter, cusoin is the copper contamination concentration in a buffered oxide etchant solution in parts per billion (ppb), t is the wafer immersion time length in minutes, k is boltzmann's constant (8.617343 . 10(-5) ev. k-1), and t is the solution temperature in kelvin. the coefficients of the three factors are of particular note; two are unity and the last is 1/3. our selection of the factor space, which was influenced by measurement capabilities, was cusoin (20-500 ppb), time (1-25 minutes), and temperature (228-323 k). at room temperature of 296 k (23 degrees c or 73 degrees f) for a solution concentration of 1 ppb and a time length of 1 minute, the predicted wafer contamination density and the 95% confidence limits are 2.06 . 10(11) and (1.75 . 10(11), 2.43 . 10(11)), respectively, which agrees with the empirical equation (2) developed in our preliminary experiments. the equations for the prediction equation and confidence intervals are explained in the section titled. analysis and interpretation of experimental results. our goal was to construct an equation for assessing future requirements by extrapolating to contamination levels below 20 ppb, the lowest value employed in the experiments.","[ramberg, john s.; parks, harold c.; maanum, kristen a.] univ arizona, coll engn, tucson, az 85721 usa","ramberg, js (reprint author), univ arizona, coll engn, tucson, az 85721 usa.","box g. e. p., 2007, empirical model buil; box g, 2010, qual eng, v22, p60, doi 10.1080/08982110903510297; graybill f, 1969, intro matrices appl; hattori t., 1990, solid state technol, p51; hogg r.v., 1992, appl stat eng phys s; hsu e, 1992, j electrochem soc, v139, p3659, doi 10.1149/1.2069139; hunter js, 1985, j qual technol, v17, p210; jastrzebski l., 1990, proceedings of the sixth international symposium on silicon materials science and technology: semiconductor silicon 1990, p614; jones b, 2011, j qual technol, v43, p1; jones b, 2009, j qual technol, v41, p340; lenth rv, 1989, technometrics, v31, p469, doi 10.2307/1269997; miki n., 1991, p 6 s aut int circ m, p133; montgomery d. c., 2005, design anal expt; myers r. h, 2009, response surface met; pandit v, 2006, j electrochem soc, v153, pg970, doi 10.1149/1.2337088; parks hg, 1994, ieee t semiconduct m, v7, p249, doi 10.1109/66.311326","16","1","1","1","7","amer soc quality control-asqc","2012","161","174","14","ramberg, john s.; parks, harold c.; maanum, kristen a.","0.13","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0"

"177","phase i risk-adjusted control charts for monitoring surgical performance by considering categorical covariates","article","binary outcome; change-point model; likelihood-ratio test; logistic regression; riskadjustment model; surgical performance","in recent years risk-adjusted control charts have been increasingly studied for monitoring surgical outcomes by accounting for patients' health conditions prior to surgery. however, most existing research focuses on phase ii monitoring, and very little work has been done on phase i control of surgical outcomes. in this paper, a general phase i risk-adjusted control chart is proposed for monitoring binary surgical outcomes based on a likelihood-ratio test derived from a change-point model. different from the existing methods, this paper further shows that the binary surgical outcomes depend on not only the patient conditions described by the parsonnet scores but also on other categorical operational covariates, such as different surgeons. the proposed risk-adjustment model is fitted by incorporating dummy variables to reflect different surgeon groups' performance. the analysis of a case study and simulation results show that the inclusion of surgeon groups as a categorical covariate in the risk-adjustment model can effectively reflect the inherent data heterogeneity, thus improving the estimation of the risk-adjustment model parameters. as expected, the proposed risk-adjusted control charts can achieve a better detection performance by including the surgeon covariate.","[paynabar, kamran; jin, jionghua (judy)] univ michigan, dept ind & operat engn, ann arbor, mi 48109 usa; [yeh, arthur b.] bowling green state univ, dept operat res & appl stat, bowling green, oh 43403 usa","paynabar, k (reprint author), univ michigan, dept ind & operat engn, ann arbor, mi 48109 usa.","biswas p, 2008, stat med, v27, p3382, doi 10.1002/sim.3216; casella g., 1990, stat inference; cook da, 2003, crit care med, v31, p1676, doi 10.1097/01.ccm.0000065273.63224.a8; gandy a, 2010, biometrika, v97, p375, doi 10.1093/biomet/asq004; grigg o, 2004, j roy stat soc a sta, v167, p523, doi 10.1111/j.1467-985x.2004.0apm2.x; grigg oa, 2004, stat med, v23, p1593, doi 10.1002/sim.1763; grigg o, 2007, j am stat assoc, v102, p140, doi 10.1198/016214506000001121; gurevich g, 2005, j stat plan infer, v131, p313, doi 10.1016/j.jspi.2004.03.004; mahmoud ma, 2007, qual reliab eng int, v23, p247, doi 10.1002/qre.788; mccullagh p, 1989, gen linear models; myers rh, 2010, wiley ser probab st, p1, doi 10.1002/9780470556986; sego lh, 2009, stat med, v28, p1386, doi 10.1002/sim.3546; shang yf, 2011, j qual technol, v43, p196; spiegelhalter dj, 2003, int j qual health c, v15, p1; steiner s h, 2000, biostatistics, v1, p441, doi 10.1093/biostatistics/1.4.441; steiner sh, 2010, stat med, v29, p444, doi 10.1002/sim.3788; sullivan jh, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p265; sullivan jh, 2002, computation stat, v17, p289, doi 10.1007/s001800200107; sullivan jh, 2000, iie trans, v32, p537, doi 10.1080/07408170008963929; treasure t., 1997, independent rev adul; waldie p., 1998, globe mail a    1027; worsley k. j., 1979, j am stat assoc, v74, p365; yeh ab, 2009, iie trans, v41, p931, doi 10.1080/07408170902735400; zamba kd, 2006, technometrics, v48, p539, doi 10.1198/004017006000000291; zou cl, 2006, iie trans, v38, p1093, doi 10.1080/07408170600728913","25","18","19","1","20","amer soc quality control-asqc","2012","39","53","15","paynabar, kamran; jin, jionghua (judy); yeh, arthur b.","2.25","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","3","3","2","3","6","1"

"179","estimation for conformance proportions in a normal variance components model","article","generalized pivotal quantity; modified large sample; parametric bootstrap; process-capability index; tolerance interval","two approaches are proposed for constructing one- and two-sided confidence limits for conformance proportions in a normal variance components model. one approach is based on the concepts of a generalized pivotal quantity, and the other is developed using the modified large-sample method for estimating linear combinations of variance components. the performance of the proposed methods is evaluated through detailed simulation studies. the results reveal that the empirical coverage probabilities for both methods are close to the claimed values and hence their performance is judged to be satisfactory. nonetheless, the modified large sample-based method might be recommended in practical applications due to its slightly better performance and computational ease. the framework established in this article can be applied to conformance proportion questions arising in arbitrary balanced mixed linear-model situations. the methods are illustrated using three real datasets. finally, a bootstrap calibration approach is adopted to have empirical coverage probabilities sufficiently close to the nominal level for the proposed methods.","[lee, hsin-i; liao, chen-tuo] natl taiwan univ, inst agron, div biometry, taipei 10617, taiwan","lee, hi (reprint author), natl taiwan univ, inst agron, div biometry, taipei 10617, taiwan.","burdick r, 1992, confidence intervals; graybill fa, 1980, j am stat assoc, v75, p869, doi 10.2307/2287174; hoffman d, 2005, j biopharm stat, v15, p283, doi 10.1081/bip-200048826; hoffman d, 2010, technometrics, v52, p303, doi 10.1198/tech.2010.09171; howe wg, 1969, j am stat assoc, v64, p610, doi 10.2307/2283644; hsu jc, 1994, biometrika, v81, p103; iyer hk, 2002, 200210 col stat u; jensen wa, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p349; kotz s, 2002, j qual technol, v34, p2; krishnamoorthy k, 2005, j stat plan infer, v128, p219, doi 10.1016/j.jspi.2003.09.025; krishnamoorthy k, 2004, technometrics, v46, p44, doi [10.1198/004017004000000103, 10.1198/0040170040000000103]; krishnamoorthy k, 2009, stat tolerance regio; lee yh, 2004, j am stat assoc, v99, p467, doi 10.1198/016214504000000322; liao ct, 2005, technometrics, v47, p323, doi 10.1198/004017005000000102; liao ct, 2004, stat sinica, v14, p217; montgomery d. c., 2005, intro stat quality c; ott e.r., 2005, process quality cont; patterson pl, 2006, thesis colorado stat; perakis m, 2002, j stat comput sim, v72, p707, doi 10.1080/00949650290031471; satterthwaite fe, 1946, biometrics bull, v2, p110, doi 10.2307/3002019; ting n, 1990, j statistical comput, v35, p135; topalidou e, 2009, qual reliab eng int, v25, p773, doi 10.1002/qre.999; wald a, 1946, ann math stat, v17, p208, doi 10.1214/aoms/1177730981; wallis wa, 1951, p 2 berk s math stat, p43; wang c. m., 1996, j qual technol, v28, p216; wang cm, 1994, technometrics, v36, p162, doi 10.2307/1270228; wang hy, 2009, technometrics, v51, p25, doi 10.1198/tech.2009.0003; weerahandi s, 1993, j am stat assoc, v88, p899, doi 10.2307/2290779; weerahandi s, 1992, technometrics, v34, p83, doi 10.2307/1269555; wilks ss, 1941, ann math stat, v12, p91, doi 10.1214/aoms/1177731788; woodall wh, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p309","31","5","5","2","3","amer soc quality control-asqc","2012","63","79","17","lee, hsin-i; liao, chen-tuo","0.63","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","2","1","1","0","0"

"184","weighted cusum control charts for monitoring poisson processes with varying sample sizes","article","average run length; incidence rate; likelihood ratio; statistical process control; surveillance","monitoring inhomogeneous poisson processes with varying sample sizes has attracted considerable attention recently in both industrial quality control and public-health surveillance. one of the key challenges in these applications is that a change in incidence rate may be masked by changes of sample sizes. the conventional poisson cumulative sum (cusum) chart designed for detecting a prespecified change in the incidence rate could perform poorly when the actual change is different from the prespecified one. this phenomenon is especially prominent when the sample size is nonconstant and varies over time. to efficiently detect changes in the incidence rate with varying sample sizes, this paper proposes a class of weighted cusum (wcusum) schemes with general weight functions applied to the likelihood-ratio statistic. the comparison results with the traditional poisson cusum method and other alternatives favor the proposed method. an example in health-care surveillance is used to illustrate the application of the proposed method.","[jiang, wei] shanghai jiao tong univ, antai coll econ & management, shanghai 200030, peoples r china; [shu, lianjie] univ macau, fac business adm, taipa, macau, peoples r china; [tsui, kwok-leung] city univ hong kong, dept mech engn & engn management, kowloon, hong kong, peoples r china; [tsui, kwok-leung] georgia inst technol, sch ind & syst engn, atlanta, ga 30332 usa","jiang, w (reprint author), shanghai jiao tong univ, antai coll econ & management, shanghai 200030, peoples r china.","amari s., 1985, lect notes stat; beaton ae, 1974, technometrics, v16, p147, doi 10.2307/1267936; box gep, 1992, quality reliability, v8, p17; capizzi g, 2003, technometrics, v45, p199, doi 10.1198/0040170030000000023; dong y, 2008, j am stat assoc, v103, p843, doi 10.1198/016214508000000166; hawkins d.m., 1998, cumulative sum chart; huber p.j., 1981, robust stat; jensen wa, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p349; kullback s, 1951, ann math stat, v22, p79, doi 10.1214/aoms/1177729694; lu cw, 1999, j qual technol, v31, p166; lucas jm, 1982, technometrics, v24, p199, doi 10.2307/1268679; lucas jm, 1982, j qual technol, v14, p51; martz hf, 1996, reliab eng syst safe, v51, p201, doi 10.1016/0951-8320(95)00117-4; mei yj, 2011, stat sinica in press; montgomery d.c., 2009, intro stat quality c; moustakides gv, 1986, ann stat, v14, p1379, doi 10.1214/aos/1176350164; page es, 1955, biometrika, v42, p243, doi 10.2307/2333440; rossi g, 1999, stat med, v18, p2111, doi 10.1002/(sici)1097-0258(19990830)18:16<2111::aid-sim171>3.0.co;2-q; royall rm, 1997, stat evidence likeli; ryan ag, 2010, j qual technol, v42, p260; ryan tp, 1997, j qual technol, v29, p86; sego lh, 2008, stat med, v27, p1225, doi 10.1002/sim.3019; shu l, 2011, stat med in press; shu lj, 2008, j qual technol, v40, p194; tsui k.-l., 2008, qual eng, v20, p435, doi doi 10.1080/08982110802334138; woodall wh, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p89; yashchin e, 1989, technometrics, v31, p321, doi 10.2307/3556142","27","10","11","2","13","amer soc quality control-asqc","2011","346","362","17","jiang, wei; shu, lianjie; tsui, kwok-leung","1.11","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","3","2","1","2","0"

"187","profile monitoring with binary data and random predictors","article","categorical response; exponential weighted moving average; generalized linear model; profile monitoring; random explanatory variables; statistical process control","the purpose of profile monitoring is to check the stability over time of relationships between response variables and one or more explanatory variables. in many applications, categorical response variables are common and a generalized linear model is usually utilized to model this kind of profile for quality improvement. in practice, different profiles often have random explanatory variables and these variables require careful monitoring as well. statistical process control is important and challenging for monitoring profiles in such situations. a novel control chart is proposed by integrating an exponentially weighted moving-average scheme and a likelihood-ratio test for the parameters of a logistic regression model. this new scheme not only monitors the functional relationship of the profile but also the mean of the explanatory variables. the proposed chart has reasonable computational and implementation complexity and is efficient in detecting shifts. the simulation results show that it performs better than the standard benchmarks in the literatures for the array of simulation examples that we consider. a real example from the electronic industries is used to illustrate the implementation of the proposed approach.","[zou, changliang] nankai univ, lpmc, tianjin 300071, peoples r china; [zou, changliang] nankai univ, dept stat, tianjin 300071, peoples r china; [shang, yanfen; tsung, fugee] hong kong univ sci & technol, dept ind engn & logist management, kowloon, hong kong, peoples r china","zou, cl (reprint author), nankai univ, lpmc, tianjin 300071, peoples r china.","chicken e, 2009, j qual technol, v41, p198; colosimo bm, 2008, j qual technol, v40, p1; ding y, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p199; gurevich g, 2005, j stat plan infer, v131, p313, doi 10.1016/j.jspi.2004.03.004; jensen wa, 2008, j qual technol, v40, p167; jensen wa, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p349; jensen wa, 2009, j qual technol, v41, p18; kang l, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p418; kazemzadeh rb, 2008, commun stat-theor m, v37, p1671, doi 10.1080/03610920701691714; kim k, 2003, j qual technol, v35, p317; lowry ca, 1992, technometrics, v34, p46, doi 10.2307/1269551; lucas jm, 1990, technometrics, v32, p1, doi 10.2307/1269835; mahmoud ma, 2008, commun stat-simul c, v37, p2106, doi 10.1080/03610910802305017; mahmoud ma, 2004, technometrics, v46, p380, doi 10.1198/004017004000000455; mccullagh p, 1989, gen linear models; qiu ph, 2010, stat sinica, v20, p1655; qiu ph, 2010, technometrics, v52, p265, doi 10.1198/tech.2010.08188; reynolds mr, 2000, iie trans, v32, p515, doi 10.1023/a:1007671903559; serfling r, 1980, approximation theore; somerville se, 2002, int j prod res, v40, p2991, doi 10.1080/00207540210140040; steiner s h, 2000, biostatistics, v1, p441, doi 10.1093/biostatistics/1.4.441; steiner sh, 1998, j roy stat soc c-app, v47, p203, doi 10.1111/1467-9876.00107; williams jd, 2007, qual reliab eng int, v23, p925, doi 10.1002/qre.858; woodall wh, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p309; woodall wh, 2007, producao, v17, p420, doi doi 10.1590/s0103-65132007000300002; yeh ab, 2009, iie trans, v41, p931, doi 10.1080/07408170902735400; zhang h, 2009, iie trans, v41, p335, doi 10.1080/07408170802323000; zou cl, 2007, technometrics, v49, p395, doi 10.1198/004017007000000164; zou cl, 2007, j qual technol, v39, p364; zou cl, 2006, iie trans, v38, p1093, doi 10.1080/07408170600728913; zou cl, 2009, stat sinica, v19, p1337; zou cl, 2008, technometrics, v50, p512, doi 10.1198/004017008000000433","32","33","34","1","16","amer soc quality control-asqc","2011","196","208","13","shang, yanfen; tsung, fugee; zou, changliang","3.67","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","2","2","6","5","9","7","1"

"196","monitoring batch processes with multiple on-off steps in semiconductor manufacturing","article","batch-processing stages; health index; heterogeneous variation; multivariate statistical process control; sensor data; signal map","a modern semiconductor manufacturing line is made of hundreds of sequential batch-processing stages. each of these stages consists of many steps carried out by expensive tools, which are monitored by numerous sensors capable of sampling at intervals of seconds. the sensor readings of each run constitute profiles, which can include extremely drastic changes. the heterogeneous variations at different profile points are mainly due to on-off recipe actions at specific points. in addition, the analysis of these profiles is further complicated by long-term trends due to tool aging and short-term effects specific to the first wafer in a lot cycle. statistical process control methods that fail to take these effects into consideration will lead to frequent false alarms. a systematic method is proposed to address these challenges. first, a reference profile is determined for each sensor variable that describes the on-off actions. next, level shifts of these profiles in each step are established to capture and remove intrinsic variations due to long-term aging trends and the short-term first-wafer effects. the residuals are used to formulate a health index, and this index can be used to monitor the health of the equipment and detect faulty wafers efficiently.","[lee, shui-pin] ching yun univ, dept ind engn & management, tao yuan 32097, taiwan; [chao, an-kuo; tseng, sheng-tsiang] natl tsing hua univ, inst stat, hsinchu 30013, taiwan; [tsung, fugee] hong kong univ sci & technol, dept ind engn & logist management, kowloon, hong kong, peoples r china; [wong, david shan hill] natl tsing hua univ, dept chem engn, hsinchu 30013, taiwan","lee, sp (reprint author), ching yun univ, dept ind engn & management, tao yuan 32097, taiwan.","akima h, 1970, j acm, v17, p589, doi 10.1145/321607.321609; apley dw, 2010, technometrics, v52, p277, doi 10.1198/tech.2010.09151; box gep, 1954, ann math stat, v25, p290, doi 10.1214/aoms/1177728786; chang tc, 2006, j stat comput sim, v76, p889, doi 10.1080/10629360500282171; chen t, 2010, comput chem eng, v34, p500, doi 10.1016/j.compchemeng.2009.08.007; cherry ga, 2006, ieee t semiconduct m, v19, p159, doi 10.1109/tsm.2006.873524; chicken e, 2009, j qual technol, v41, p198; chou ym, 1999, commun stat-simul c, v28, p1031, doi 10.1080/03610919908813591; ding y, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p199; ge zq, 2010, ieee t semiconduct m, v23, p99, doi 10.1109/tsm.2009.2039188; jensen wa, 2008, j qual technol, v40, p167; jensen wa, 2009, j qual technol, v41, p18; jin jh, 1999, technometrics, v41, p327, doi 10.2307/1271349; johnson ra, 2007, appl multivariate st, p241; jones mc, 1992, am stat, v46, p140, doi 10.2307/2684184; kaistha n, 2004, technometrics, v46, p53, doi 10.1198/004017004000000112; kang l, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p418; kim k, 2003, j qual technol, v35, p317; li wh, 2000, j process contr, v10, p471, doi 10.1016/s0959-1524(00)00022-6; mahmoud ma, 2007, qual reliab eng int, v23, p247, doi 10.1002/qre.788; may gs, 2006, fundamentals semicon; montgomery d. c., 2005, intro stat quality c; nomikos p, 1995, chemometr intell lab, v30, p97, doi 10.1016/0169-7439(95)00043-7; nomikos p, 1995, technometrics, v37, p41, doi 10.2307/1269152; noorossana r, 2008, commun stat-theor m, v37, p425, doi 10.1080/03610920701653136; qiu ph, 2010, technometrics, v52, p265, doi 10.1198/tech.2010.08188; spitzlsperger g, 2005, ieee t semiconduct m, v18, p528, doi 10.1109/tsm.2005.858495; williams jd, 2007, j agr biol envir st, v12, p216, doi 10.1198/108571107x197779; wise bm, 1999, j chemometr, v13, p379, doi 10.1002/(sici)1099-128x(199905/08)13:3/4<379::aid-cem556>3.0.co;2-n; woodall wh, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p309; woodall william h., 2007, prod., v17, p420, doi 10.1590/s0103-65132007000300002; zhu jj, 2010, qual eng, v22, p1, doi 10.1080/08982110903344804; zou cl, 2007, technometrics, v49, p395, doi 10.1198/004017007000000164; zou cl, 2006, iie trans, v38, p1093, doi 10.1080/07408170600728913; zou cl, 2008, technometrics, v50, p512, doi 10.1198/004017008000000433","35","7","14","2","14","amer soc quality control-asqc","2011","142","157","16","lee, shui-pin; chao, an-kuo; tsung, fugee; wong, david shan hill; tseng, sheng-tsiang; jang, shi-shang","0.78","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","2","4","0"

"198","exchange algorithms for constructing model-robust experimental designs","article","d-optimality; model space; multiresponse design; robust design","optimal experimental design procedures, utilizing criteria such as d-optimality, are useful for producing designs for quantitative responses, often under nonstandard conditions such as constrained design spaces. however, these methods require a priori knowledge of the exact form of the response function, an often unrealistic assumption. model-robust designs are those that, from our perspective, are efficient with respect to a set of possible models. in this paper, we develop a model-robust technique motivated by a connection to multiresponse d-optimal design. this link spawns a generalization of the modified fedorov exchange algorithm, which is then used to construct exact model-robust designs. we also study the effectiveness of designs robust for a small set of models compared with designs that account for much larger sets. we give several examples and compare our designs with two model-robust procedures in the literature.","[smucker, byran j.] miami univ, oxford, oh 45056 usa; [del castillo, enrique; rosenberger, james l.] penn state univ, university pk, pa 16802 usa","smucker, bj (reprint author), miami univ, oxford, oh 45056 usa.","atashgah ab, 2009, optim eng, v10, p75, doi 10.1007/s11081-008-9041-7; atkinson a. c., 2007, optimum expt designs; bingham dr, 2007, technometrics, v49, p155, doi 10.1198/004017007000000038; bischoff w, 1993, j stat plan infer, v37, p69, doi 10.1016/0378-3758(93)90080-p; box gep, 1959, j am stat assoc, v54, p622; chang s, 1997, iie trans, v29, p1073, doi 10.1023/a:1018520923888; chang y, 1996, handb stat, v13, p1055; cook rd, 1982, technometrics, v24, p49, doi 10.2307/1267577; cook rd, 1980, technometrics, v22, p315, doi 10.2307/1268315; cornell ja, 1990, expt mixtures design; dette h, 1990, ann stat, v18, p1784, doi 10.1214/aos/1176347878; dette h, 2001, ann stat, v29, p1024, doi 10.1214/aos/1013699990; dumouchel w, 1994, technometrics, v36, p37, doi 10.2307/1269197; emmett m., 2007, d optimal designs mu; fang zd, 2003, j stat plan infer, v117, p305, doi 10.1016/s0378-3758(02)00387-7; fang zd, 2000, j am stat assoc, v95, p807, doi 10.2307/2669464; fedorov v. v., 1972, theory optimal expt; frisbee se, 1994, eur j pharm biopharm, v40, p355; goos p, 2005, comput stat data an, v49, p201, doi 10.1016/j.csda.2004.05.032; heinsman j. a., 1995, qual eng, v7, p583; heredia-langner a, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p263; johnson me, 1983, technometrics, v25, p271, doi 10.2307/1268612; jones b, 2008, j stat plan infer, v138, p86, doi 10.1016/j.jspi.2007.05.021; jones ba, 2009, j stat plan infer, v139, p45, doi 10.1016/j.jspi.2008.05.015; khuri a. i, 1996, response surfaces de; kiefer j, 1959, j roy stat soc b, v21, p272; kurotschka v. g., 1996, m puri festschrift, p193; lauter e., 1974, statistics, v5, p379; li w, 2000, technometrics, v42, p345, doi 10.2307/1270944; meyer rk, 1995, technometrics, v37, p60, doi 10.2307/1269153; mitchell tj, 1974, technometrics, v16, p203, doi 10.2307/1267940; montepiedra g, 1997, j stat plan infer, v63, p97, doi 10.1016/s0378-3758(96)00199-1; neff a., 1996, thesis state u; piepel g. f., 2005, quality engineering, v17, p579, doi 10.1080/08982110500225364; piepel gf, 1988, j qual technol, v20, p125; rajagopal r, 2005, technometrics, v47, p152, doi 10.1198/004017005000000120; sas, 2000, sas 2000 2004 vers 9; sun d. x., 1993, thesis u waterloo; welch wj, 1983, biometrika, v70, p205; zellner a, 1962, j am stat assoc, v57, p348, doi 10.2307/2281644; zhou j, 2008, j stat plan infer, v138, p4081, doi 10.1016/j.jspi.2008.03.013","41","6","6","0","8","amer soc quality control-asqc","2011","28","42","15","smucker, byran j.; del castillo, enrique; rosenberger, james l.","0.67","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","0","1","1","0","0","2","0"

"205","estimating the standard deviation in quality-control applications","article","control charts; mean-squared error; process capability; relative efficiency; statistical process control","in estimating the standard deviation of a normally distributed random variable, a multiple of the sample range is often used instead of the sample standard deviation in view of the range's computational simplicity. although it is well known that use of the sample standard deviation is more efficient if the sample size exceeds 2, many statistical quality-control textbooks argue that the loss in efficiency when using the sample range to estimate the process standard deviation is very small with relatively small sample sizes. in this paper, we show that this loss in efficiency can be relatively large even for very small sample sizes and thus strongly advise against using range-based methods. we found that some previously published tables of relative efficiencies were either mislabeled or inaccurate. we also make some recommendations when a number of samples have been taken over time.","[mahmoud, mahmoud a.] cairo univ, dept stat, fac econ & polit sci, cairo, egypt; [epprecht, eugenio k.] puc rio, dept ind engn, br-22451900 rio de janeiro, brazil; [woodall, william h.] virginia tech, dept stat, blacksburg, va 24061 usa; [woodall, william h.] virginia tech, asq, blacksburg, va 24061 usa","mahmoud, ma (reprint author), cairo univ, dept stat, fac econ & polit sci, cairo, egypt.","bissell af, 1990, j r stat soc c-appl, v39, p331; braun wj, 2008, j qual technol, v40, p332; davies ol, 1934, j roy stat soc     s, v1, p76; ewhart wa, 1931, ec control quality m; grant el, 1996, stat quality control; hald a., 1952, stat theory eng appl; jensen wa, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p349; kenett r. s., 1998, modern ind stat desi; montgomery d.c., 2009, intro stat quality c; nist/sematech,, e hdb stat meth; orr er, 2000, process quality cont; ott e, 1975, process quality cont; vardeman sb, 1999, iie trans, v31, p503, doi 10.1023/a:1007694121519; woodall w., 2000, qual eng, v13, p211","14","31","32","0","6","amer soc quality control-asqc","2010","348","357","10","mahmoud, mahmoud a.; henderson, g. robin; epprecht, eugenio k.; woodall, william h.","3.1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","2","3","7","3","7","7","0"
"206","d-optimal and d-efficient equivalent-estimation second-order split-plot designs","article","coordinate-exchange algorithm; d-optimality; equivalent estimation; generalized least squares; ordinary least squares; split-plot design","industrial experiments often involve factors that are hard to change or costly to manipulate and thus make it undesirable to use a complete randomization. in such cases, the split-plot design structure is a cost-efficient alternative that reduces the number of independent settings of the hard-to-change factors. in general, model estimation for split-plot designs requires the use of generalized least squares (gls). however, for some split-plot designs (including not only classical agricultural split-plot designs, but also some second-order split-plot response surface designs), ordinary least squares (ols) estimates are equivalent to gls estimates. these designs are called equivalent-estimation designs and offer the advantage that estimation of the factor effects does not require estimation of the variance components in the split-plot model. as an alternative to these equivalent-estimation designs, one can use d-optimal designs that guarantee efficient estimation of the fixed effects of the statistical model that is appropriate given the split-plot structure. we explore the relationship between equivalent-estimation and d-optimal split-plot designs for a second-order response surface model and propose an algorithm for generating d-efficient equivalent-estimation split-plot designs. this approach allows for a flexible choice of the number of hard-to-change factors, the number of easy-to-change factors, the number of whole plots, and the total sample size.","[macharia, harrison; goos, peter] univ antwerp, fac appl econ, b-2000 antwerp, belgium; [macharia, harrison; goos, peter] univ antwerp, statua ctr stat, b-2000 antwerp, belgium; [goos, peter] erasmus univ, erasmus sch econ, rotterdam, netherlands","macharia, h (reprint author), univ antwerp, fac appl econ, prinsstr 13, b-2000 antwerp, belgium.","almimi aa, 2008, j qual technol, v40, p154; almini aa, 2009, j qual technol, v41, p272; bingham d, 1999, technometrics, v41, p62, doi 10.2307/1270995; bingham d.r., 2004, j royal stat soc c, v54, p955; gilmour sg, 2009, j r stat soc c-appl, v58, p467, doi 10.1111/j.1467-9876.2009.00662.x; goos p, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p162; goos p, 2003, technometrics, v45, p235, doi 10.1198/004017003000000050; goos p, 2001, j qual technol, v33, p436; goos p, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p12; goos p, 2002, optimal design block; goos p, 2006, stat neerl, v60, p361, doi 10.1111/j.1467-9574.2006.00333.x; huang p, 1998, technometrics, v40, p314, doi 10.2307/1270532; jones b, 2007, j roy stat soc c-app, v56, p347, doi 10.1111/j.1467-9876.2007.00581.x; jones b, 2009, j qual technol, v41, p340; jones mr, 2009, health phys, v96, p67, doi 10.1097/01.hp.0000327660.36130.ee; khuri ai, 1992, technometrics, v34, p26, doi 10.2307/1269549; kowalski sm, 2002, technometrics, v44, p72, doi 10.1198/004017002753398344; kulahci m, 2005, technometrics, v47, p495, doi 10.1198/004017005000000427; letsinger jd, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p381; littell rc, 1996, sas system mixed mod; mcelroy fw, 1967, j am stat assoc, v62, p1302, doi 10.2307/2283779; mcleod rg, 2008, j qual technol, v40, p227; park wb, 2007, fems immunol med mic, v49, p56, doi 10.1111/j.1574-695x.2006.00170.x; parker pa, 2006, qual reliab eng int, v22, p291, doi 10.1002/qre.771; parker pa, 2007, j qual technol, v39, p376; trinca la, 2001, technometrics, v43, p25, doi 10.1198/00401700152404291; vining gg, 2008, j qual technol, v40, p394; vining gg, 2005, j qual technol, v37, p115; webb df, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p1; wesley wr, 2009, j qual technol, v41, p165","30","17","17","0","6","amer soc quality control-asqc","2010","358","372","15","macharia, harrison; goos, peter","1.7","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","4","1","2","4","1","3","2","0"

"214","an evaluation of a glr control chart for monitoring the process mean","article","adaptive control chart; average time to signal; cusum chart; generalized likelihood ratio; shewhart chart; statistical process control; steady state; surveillance","this paper considers the problem of monitoring the mean of a normally distributed process variable when the objective is to effectively detect both small and large shifts in this mean. the performance of a generalized likelihood ratio (glr) control chart is evaluated, where the likelihood ratio is based on a moving window of past observations. the performance of the glr chart is compared with the performance of other options, such as combinations of shewhart and cumulative sum (cusum) charts and an adaptive cusum chart, that have been proposed for detecting a wide range of shift sizes. performance is evaluated for sustained shifts, transient shifts, and drifts in the mean. it is shown that the overall performance of the glr chart is at least as good as these other options. these other options have multiple control-chart parameters that allow for the charts to be tuned to be more sensitive to certain shifts that may be of interest. however, the glr chart does not require users to specify the values of any control-chart parameters other than the size of the window and the control limit. we recommend a specific window size and provide a table of control limits corresponding to specified values of the false-alarm rate, so it is very easy to design the glr chart for use in applications. simulating the performance of the glr chart is time consuming, but approximating the glr chart with a set of cusum charts provides a much faster way of evaluating the performance of the glr chart for research purposes.","[reynolds, marion r., jr.; lou, jianying] virginia tech, dept stat, blacksburg, va 24061 usa; [reynolds, marion r., jr.] virginia tech, dept forest resources & environm conservat, blacksburg, va 24061 usa","reynolds, mr (reprint author), virginia tech, dept stat, blacksburg, va 24061 usa.","apley dw, 1999, iie trans, v31, p1123, doi 10.1080/07408179908969913; capizzi g, 2003, technometrics, v45, p199, doi 10.1198/0040170030000000023; capizzi g, 2001, environmetrics, v12, p749, doi 10.1002/env.497; domangue r, 1991, technometrics, v33, p299, doi 10.2307/1268782; dragalin v, 1997, commun stat-simul c, v26, p67, doi 10.1080/03610919708813368; gombay e, 2000, stat probabil lett, v49, p195, doi 10.1016/s0167-7152(00)00048-1; han d, 2007, stat sinica, v17, p1139; hawkins d. m., 1998, cumulative sum contr; hawkins dm, 2005, technometrics, v47, p164, doi 10.1198/004017004000000644; hawkins dm, 2003, j qual technol, v35, p355; jiang w, 2008, iie trans, v40, p992, doi 10.1080/07408170801961412; lai tl, 1995, j r stat soc b, v57, p613; lai tl, 2001, stat sinica, v11, p303; lorden g, 1971, ann math stat, v42, p1897, doi 10.1214/aoms/1177693055; lucas jm, 1982, j qual technol, v14, p51; montgomery d.c., 2009, intro stat quality c; page es, 1954, biometrika, v41, p100, doi 10.2307/2333009; reynolds mr, 2006, technometrics, v48, p550, doi 10.1189/004017006000000255; reynolds mr, 2005, technometrics, v47, p409, doi 10.1198/004017005000000382; reynolds mr, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p343; reynolds mr, 2004, technometrics, v46, p200, doi 10.1198/004017004000000257; runger gc, 2003, qual reliab eng int, v19, p387, doi 10.1002/qre.591; ryu j., 2010, j qual technol, v42, p311; shu lj, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p135; siegmund d, 1995, ann stat, v23, p255, doi 10.1214/aos/1176324466; sparks rs, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p157; westgard jo, 1977, clin chem, v23, p1881; willsky as, 1976, ieee t automat contr, v21, p108, doi 10.1109/tac.1976.1101146; woodall wh, 2005, technometrics, v47, p425, doi 10.1198/004017005000000256; wu z, 2009, iie trans, v41, p642, doi 10.1080/07408170802712582; wu z, 2008, comput stat data an, v53, p496, doi 10.1016/j.csda.2008.08.032; zhao y, 2005, iie trans, v37, p1047, doi 10.1080/07408170500232321","32","51","51","0","14","amer soc quality control-asqc","2010","287","310","24","reynolds, marion r., jr.; lou, jianying","5.1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","8","4","6","6","4","14","7","1"
"215","optimal design of a cusum chart for a mean shift of unknown size","article","multi-cusum; quality-control chart design; relative run length; statistical process control; unknown mean shifts","the cumulative sum (cusum) control chart is one of the most popular methods used to detect a process mean shift. when one specific size of the mean shift is assumed, the cusum chart can be optimally designed in terms of average run length (arl). in practice, however, the size of the mean shift is usually unknown, and the cusum chart can perform poorly when the actual size of the mean shift is significantly different from the assumed size. in this paper, we assign a probability distribution to the size of the mean shift to represent the lack of knowledge of the shift size. we use an arl-based performance measure, called expected weighted run length (ewrl), and propose a method to optimally design a cusum chart based on ewrl. this method can be easily extended to other cusum-based control charts, such as weighted cusum and multi-cusum charts proposed in the literature. the numerical results show that the cusum or the cusum-based chart can be improved by our proposed method in terms of ewrl.","[hyu, ong-hyun; wan, hong] purdue univ, sch ind engn, w lafayette, in 47907 usa; [kim, sujin] natl univ singapore, dept ind & syst engn, singapore 117576, singapore","hyu, oh (reprint author), purdue univ, sch ind engn, w lafayette, in 47907 usa.","apley dw, 1999, iie trans, v31, p1123, doi 10.1080/07408179908969913; bagshaw m, 1975, j roy stat soc b met, v37, p413; brook d, 1972, biometrika, v59, p539; chen a, 2007, iie trans, v39, p1127, doi 10.1080/07408170701315321; han d, 2007, int j reliab qual sa, v14, p81, doi 10.1142/s0218539307002520; jiang w, 2008, iie trans, v40, p992, doi 10.1080/07408170801961412; jiao jr, 2008, int j adv manuf tech, v35, p1234, doi 10.1007/s00170-006-0803-0; kincaid d. r., 2002, numerical anal math; lorden g, 1973, technometrics, v15, p167, doi 10.2307/1266833; lucas jm, 1982, j qual technol, v14, p51; montgomery d. c, 2004, intro stat quality c; moustakides gv, 1986, ann stat, v14, p1379, doi 10.1214/aos/1176350164; page es, 1954, biometrika, v41, p100, doi 10.2307/2333009; reynolds mr, 2010, j qual technol, v42, p287; shu lj, 2008, j qual technol, v40, p194; shu lj, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p135; siegmund d, 1995, ann stat, v23, p255, doi 10.1214/aos/1176324466; siegmund david, 1985, sequential anal test; sparks rs, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p157; wald a, 1945, ann math stat, v16, p117, doi 10.1214/aoms/1177731118; wu z, 2004, int j prod res, v42, p379, doi 10.1080/00207540310001614169; zhao y, 2005, iie trans, v37, p1047, doi 10.1080/07408170500232321","22","17","18","0","14","amer soc quality control-asqc","2010","311","326","16","hyu, ong-hyun; wan, hong; kim, sujin","1.7","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","2","2","4","4","4"
"216","sensitivity analysis of optimal designs for accelerated life testing","article","design of experiments; reliability testing; robustness; uc-optimality; use condition","in experimental testing, it is desirable to select combinations of input factors that yield optimal results given an objective specified by a practitioner. often this objective involves minimizing the uncertainty in a parameter or prediction estimate. to determine the experimental design to achieve such an objective, it is necessary to understand the relationship between the testing variables and the response. alphabetic optimal designs are commonly used in such applications based largely on the ease of their construction with advanced statistical software. however, many publications cite concerns with the overall robustness of such designs to small departures in parameter estimates. this paper examines the issue of model parameter sensitivity to the selection of an accelerated life test based on the uc-optimality criterion, minimizing of the prediction variance at the usage condition, using a generalized linear model framework. we will examine the trade-off implications of choice of experimental design, sample size, and censoring.","[monroe, eric m.] intel corp, chandler, az 85226 usa; [pan, rong; montgomery, douglas c.] arizona state univ, tempe, az 85287 usa; [anderson-cook, christine m.] los alamos natl lab, stat sci grp, los alamos, nm 87545 usa; [borror, connie m.] arizona state univ, glendale, az 85306 usa","monroe, em (reprint author), intel corp, chandler, az 85226 usa.","aitkin m., 1980, applied statistics, v29, p156, doi 10.2307/2986301; chaloner k, 1995, stat sci, v10, p273, doi 10.1214/ss/1177009939; kleijnen jpc, 1997, j stat comput sim, v57, p111, doi 10.1080/00949659708811805; lawless jf, 2003, stat models methods; li w, 2000, technometrics, v42, p345, doi 10.2307/1270944; mccullagh p, 1989, gen linear models; meeker wq, 1998, stat methods reliabi; monroe e, 2009, thesis arizona state; monroe em, 2009, qual reliab eng int, v25, p111, doi 10.1002/qre.944; nelson wb, 2005, ieee t reliab, v54, p370, doi 10.1109/tr.2005.853289; nelson wb, 2005, ieee t reliab, v54, p194, doi 10.1109/tr.2005.847247; ozolgodfrey a, 2007, j stat plan infer, v138, p203; saltelli a, 1999, technometrics, v41, p39, doi 10.2307/1270993; saltelli a, 2000, stat sci, v15, p377; shirley c, 1994, int reliability phys, v32, p72; sobol i. m., 1993, math model comput ex, v1, p407, doi doi 10.2514/1.28511; whitehead j., 1980, applied statistics, v29, p268, doi 10.2307/2346901; zhang y, 2006, technometrics, v48, p49, doi 10.1198/004017005000000373","18","15","15","0","5","amer soc quality control-asqc","2010","121","135","15","monroe, eric m.; pan, rong; anderson-cook, christine m.; montgomery, douglas c.; borror, connie m.","1.5","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","3","0","4","3","2","2","1","0","0"

"224","determining statistical process control baseline periods in long historical data streams","article","agglomerative hierarchical clustering; baseline; change-point identification; cluster analysis; data mining; likelihood ratio test; statistical process control","in statistical process control (spc), models are built from baseline data that are observations during successful production. often the baseline data has to be extracted from a long steam of historical data that includes observations from both successful and unsuccessful productions. baseline periods have to be identified correctly to ensure that the spc models are correct and, subsequently, the on-line monitoring based on these models is effective. this paper proposes a new method to identify baseline periods in a long historical dataset. the method identifies baseline periods where the quality is good, the quality variable has a stable distribution, and the time intervals are sufficiently long. the proposed method is tested on a real dataset from a melting process and yields a baseline that is considered reasonable and convincing to the process engineers. simulation experiments also show that the proposed method is robust to the distribution of the quality variable by consistently identifying correct baseline periods across different distributions. in contrast, two existing methods of change-point identification are very sensitive to distribution assumptions.","[zhang, hang] arizona state univ, harrington dept bioengn, tempe, az 85287 usa; [albin, susan l.] rutgers state univ, dept ind & syst engn, piscataway, nj 08854 usa; [wagner, steven r.; nolet, daniel a.] corning inc, harrodsburg, ky 40330 usa; [gupta, suhail] pma consaltants, newark, nj 07102 usa","zhang, h (reprint author), arizona state univ, harrington dept bioengn, tempe, az 85287 usa.","besterfield c, 1999, total quality manage; costa j a, 1999, int j neural syst, v9, p195, doi 10.1142/s0129065799000186; daszykowski m, 2001, chemometr intell lab, v56, p83, doi 10.1016/s0169-7439(01)00111-3; fraley c, 1998, comput j, v41, p578, doi 10.1093/comjnl/41.8.578; fukunaga k., 1990, intro stat pattern r; garcia-escudero la, 2005, j classif, v22, p185, doi 10.1007/s00357-005-0013-8; guh rs, 2005, p i mech eng b-j eng, v219, p283, doi 10.1243/095440505x28963; han j., 2001, data mining concepts; han kf, 1995, j mol biol, v251, p176, doi 10.1006/jmbi.1995.0424; harnish p, 2008, j qual technol, v41, p3; hawkins dm, 2005, j qual technol, v37, p21; herberts t, 2004, scand j stat, v31, p347, doi 10.1111/j.1467-9469.2004.02-102.x; herbin m, 2001, pattern recogn lett, v22, p1557, doi 10.1016/s0167-8655(01)00103-9; kojadinovic i, 2004, computational stat d, v46; kothari r, 1999, pattern recogn lett, v20, p405, doi 10.1016/s0167-8655(99)00008-2; loschi rh, 2005, adv complex syst, v8, p465, doi 10.1142/s0219525905000506; montgomery dc, 2007, appl stat probabilit; ramanayake a, 2002, j stat comput sim, v74, p263; scott dw, 1992, multivariate density; silverman bw, 1986, density estimation s; son ys, 2005, statistics-abingdon, v39, p373, doi 10.1080/02331880500315339; sullivan jh, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p265; sullivan jh, 2002, j qual technol, v34, p371; sullivan jh, 2000, iie trans, v32, p537, doi 10.1080/07408170008963929; wang wj, 2004, chemometr intell lab, v72, p1, doi 10.1016/j.chemolab.2004.02.006; woodall wh, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p341; zhang h, 2007, iie trans, v39, p1103, doi 10.1080/07408170701291787","27","13","16","0","8","amer soc quality control-asqc","2010","21","35","15","zhang, hang; albin, susan l.; wagner, steven r.; nolet, daniel a.; gupta, suhail","1.3","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","2","2","2","5","1","0"
"225","simultaneous identification of premodeled and unmodeled variation patterns","article","blind source separation; factor analysis; independent components analysis; manufacturing variation reduction; multivariate statistical process control","for purposes of identifying root causes of variation in multivariate manufacturing data, many studies employ a linear structured model. one paradigm involves modeling off-line a set of variation patterns and then attempting to detect the presence or absence of those specific premodeled patterns in a sample of on-line data. in another paradigm, which requires no premodeling, the objective is to discover the nature of any variation patterns that are present, based only on the on-line data sample. in this paper, we present a method that combines the two paradigms and mitigates some of the shortcomings of each. instead of exhaustively premodeling all potential variation patterns, which is infeasible for many processes, one premodels only the patterns for which modeling is relatively easy. the characteristics of any unmodeled patterns that also happen to be present in the on-line data are discovered automatically, and they are treated in such a manner that their presence does not adversely affect the detection of the premodeled patterns. we illustrate the approach with an example from autobody assembly.","[apley, daniel w.] northwestern univ, dept ind engn & management sci, evanston, il 60208 usa; [lee, ho young] samsung, seoul, south korea","apley, dw (reprint author), northwestern univ, dept ind engn & management sci, evanston, il 60208 usa.","apley dw, 2007, iie trans, v39, p691, doi 10.1080/07408170600899573; apley dw, 1998, j manuf sci e-t asme, v120, p793, doi 10.1115/1.2830222; apley dw, 2005, ieee t autom sci eng, v2, p101, doi 10.1109/tase.2005.844436; apley dw, 2003, technometrics, v45, p220, doi 10.1198/004017003000000041; apley dw, 2001, technometrics, v43, p84, doi 10.1198/00401700152404354; barton r. r., 1996, quality engineering, v9, p107, doi 10.1080/08982119608919022; belouchrani a, 1997, ieee t signal proces, v45, p434, doi 10.1109/78.554307; box g. e. p., 1994, time series anal for; cardoso jf, 1993, iee proc-f, v140, p362, doi 10.1049/ip-f-2.1993.0054; cardoso jf, 1998, p ieee, v86, p2009, doi 10.1109/5.720250; comon p, 1994, signal process, v36, p287, doi 10.1016/0165-1684(94)90029-9; crucesalvarez sa, 2003, 4 int s ind comp an, p463; ding y, 2007, int j prod res, v45, p5485, doi 10.1080/00207540701325215; ding y, 2004, j manuf sci e-t asme, v126, p200, doi 10.1115/1.1644549; ding y, 2002, j manuf sci e-t asme, v124, p313, doi 10.1115/1.1445155; jackson je, 1980, j qual technol, v12, p201; jackson je, 1981, j qual technol, v13, p46; jin j, 1999, j manuf sci e-t asme, v121, p756, doi 10.1115/1.2833137; johnson r, 2002, appl multivariate st; lee hy, 2004, int j flex manuf sys, v16, p45, doi 10.1023/b:flex.0000039172.84756.39; muller kr, 1999, p int worksh ind com, p87; runger gc, 2007, j qual technol, v39, p159; shan xm, 2008, technometrics, v50, p332, doi 10.1198/004017008000000316; tichavsky p., 2006, p 14 eur sign proc c, p1; zhou sy, 2003, technometrics, v45, p312, doi 10.1198/004017003000000131","25","7","8","0","3","amer soc quality control-asqc","2010","36","51","16","apley, daniel w.; lee, ho young","0.7","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","0","1","0","1","1","1","0","0","1"
"226","a bayesian model-averaging approach for multiple-response optimization","article","decision theoretic approach; follow-up sampling; optimal design; preposterior analysis; quality loss functions","the characteristics that define the quality and reliability of many products and processes are often multidimensional. many of the current multiple-response optimization approaches assume a single-response model to optimize such processes and do not consider the correlations among the response data, the uncertainty in the response models, and the uncertainty in the parameter estimates of the models. failure to account for these uncertainties can result in misleading quality estimates and therefore poor process design. in this paper, we consider a bayesian decision theoretic approach to the modeling and optimization of multiple-response systems. this approach naturally accounts for the correlations among the responses, the variability of the predictions, and the uncertainty of the model parameters. we further propose a bayesian model averaging approach to account for response-model uncertainty. this approach is general and enables the consideration of many types of quality criteria and characteristics. in addition, we also consider the important follow-up question of how to allocate further resources for additional experimentation to achieve or improve on the desired quality level.","natl univ singapore, dept ind & syst engn, singapore 117548, singapore","ng, sh (reprint author), natl univ singapore, dept ind & syst engn, singapore 117548, singapore.","atkinson a. c., 1992, optimum expt designs; atkinson ac, 1996, technometrics, v38, p314, doi 10.2307/1271298; berger j., 1985, stat decision theory; brown pj, 1998, j r stat soc b, v60, p627, doi 10.1111/1467-9868.00144; brown pj, 1993, measurement regressi; buck land st., 1997, biometrics, v53, p275; chiao ch, 2001, j qual technol, v33, p451; chipman h, 1996, can j stat, v24, p17, doi 10.2307/3315687; chipman h., 2001, ims lect notes monog, v38, p67; dawid ap, 1981, biometrika, v68, p265; dumouchel w, 1994, technometrics, v36, p37, doi 10.2307/1269197; fernandez c, 2001, j econometrics, v100, p381, doi 10.1016/s0304-4076(00)00076-2; gelfand ae, 1990, j am stat assoc, v85, p398, doi 10.2307/2289776; genz a, 2002, j comput graph stat, v11, p950, doi 10.1198/106186002394; george e. i., 1998, ency stat sci update, v3, p39; george ei, 1997, stat sinica, v7, p339; george ei, 2000, biometrika, v87, p731, doi 10.1093/biomet/87.4.731; hamada m, 2001, am stat, v55, p175, doi 10.1198/000313001317098121; hoeting ja, 1999, stat sci, v14, p382; kass re, 1995, j am stat assoc, v90, p773, doi 10.1080/01621459.1995.10476572; madigan d, 1995, int stat rev, v63, p215, doi 10.2307/1403615; meyer rd, 1996, technometrics, v38, p303, doi 10.2307/1271297; meyer rd, 1992, 80 cqpi; miro-quesada g, 2004, j appl stat, v31, p251, doi 10.1080/0266476042000184019; moala fm, 2009, elicitation mu unpub; muller p, 2000, bayesian stat, v6, p1; mullerdethlefs k, 1995, adv chem phys, v90, p1; ng sh, 2004, nav res log, v51, p1129, doi 10.1002/nav.20046; o'hagan a, 2006, uncertain judgements; peterson jj, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p139; peterson jj, 2007, bayesian stat proces, p269; pignatiello jj, 1993, iie trans, v25, p5, doi 10.1080/07408179308964286; press sj, 1986, appl multivariate an; raftery ae, 1997, j am stat assoc, v92, p179, doi 10.2307/2291462; rajagopal r, 2005, j qual technol, v37, p210; rajagopal r, 2005, technometrics, v47, p152, doi 10.1198/004017005000000120; smith m, 1996, j econometrics, v75, p317, doi 10.1016/0304-4076(95)01763-1; taguchi g, 1986, intro quality eng de; vining gg, 1998, j qual technol, v30, p309; wold s, 1989, environmental professional, v11, p127; wu c.f.j, 2000, expt planning anal p; zellner a, 1986, bayesian inference d, p233","42","18","20","1","5","amer soc quality control-asqc","2010","52","68","17","ng, szu hui","1.8","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","0","0","1","3","4","4","2","2"

"229","planning and inference for a sequential accelerated life test","article","accelerated life test planning; bayesian design; sequential life test","in planning accelerated life tests (alts), initial values of some unknown model parameters must be specified so as to derive a locally optimal test plan. very often, the margin of specification error is high and the requisite level of statistical precision cannot be achieved as planned. in this paper, we propose a sequential test plan for single-variable constant-stress accelerated life test. under the sequential scheme, a test at the highest stress level is first planned and conducted. using the information obtained at the highest stress level, a bayesian framework is proposed to optimally determine both the sample allocation and stress combinations at lower stress levels of subsequent accelerated tests. this is done by minimizing the preposterior expectation of the posterior variance of the estimated life percentile of interest at use conditions. for illustration purposes, the proposed scheme is applied to alts with two and three constant stress levels and a comprehensive simulation study is presented to compare the performance of the sequential alt with that of nonsequential static testing. our results suggest that the proposed approach not only enhances the robustness of an alt plan against misspecification of model parameters but also improves its statistical efficiency.","[tang, loon ching; liu, xiao] natl univ singapore, dept ind & syst engn, singapore 119260, singapore","tang, lc (reprint author), natl univ singapore, dept ind & syst engn, singapore 119260, singapore.","barlow re, 1988, p int sch phys cours, p203; berger j., 1985, stat decision theory; chaloner k, 1992, j stat plan infer, v33, p245, doi 10.1016/0378-3758(92)90071-y; chaloner k, 1995, stat sci, v10, p273, doi 10.1214/ss/1177009939; chernoff h., 1972, sequential anal opti; fiacco a.v., 1968, nonlinear programmin; kass re, 1994, ann stat, v22, p668, doi 10.1214/aos/1176325490; liu x, 2009, qual reliab eng int, v25, p91, doi 10.1002/qre.958; meeker w., 1985, asqc basic reference, v10; meeker wq, 1993, int stat rev, v61, p147, doi 10.2307/1403600; meeker wq, 1984, technometrics, v26, p157, doi 10.2307/1268110; meeker wq, 1998, stat methods reliabi; meinhold rj, 1987, am stat, v41, p101, doi 10.2307/2684220; michlin yh, 2008, ieee t reliab, v57, p379, doi 10.1109/tr.2008.916886; montgomery d., 2003, appl stat probabilit; nelson w, 1978, technometrics, v20, p171, doi 10.2307/1268710; nelson w, 1976, technometrics, v18, p15; nelson w, 1990, accelerated testing; pascual fg, 2006, technometrics, v48, p11, doi 10.1198/004017005000000436; pascual fg, 2003, technometrics, v45, p47, doi 10.1198/004017002188618699; pascual f, 2007, ieee t reliab, v56, p85, doi 10.1109/tr.2006.890885; pilz j., 1991, bayesian estimation; tang lc, 2005, ieee t reliab, v54, p58, doi 10.1109/tr.2004.841731; tang lc, 2007, microsyst technol, v13, p891, doi 10.1007/s00542-006-0301-1; tseng st, 1994, j stat plan infer, v41, p215, doi 10.1016/0378-3758(94)90165-1; wetherill g. b., 1986, sequential methods s; zhang y, 2006, technometrics, v48, p49, doi 10.1198/004017005000000373; 1985, milstd883","28","18","18","1","14","amer soc quality control-asqc","2010","103","118","16","tang, loon ching; liu, xiao","1.8","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","0","2","1","2","4","1","4","2","0"

"245","distribution-free phase i control charts for subgroup location","article","nonparametric; shewhart chart; statistical process control","much of the work in statistical quality control is dependent on the proper completion of a phase i study. many phase i control charts are based on an implicit assumption of normally distributed process observations. in the beginning stages of process control, little information is available about the process and the normality assumption may not be reasonable. existing robust and distribution-free control charts are concerned with the establishment of phase ii control limits that are robust to nonnormality or outliers from the phase i sample. our literature review revealed no purely distribution-free phase i control-chart methods. we propose a distribution-free method for defining the in-control state of a process and identifying an in-control reference sample. the resultant reference sample can be used to estimate the process parameters for the phase ii procedure of choice. the proposed rank-based method is compared with the traditional 5 chart using monte carlo simulation. the rank-based method compares favorably to the 3 chart when the process is normally distributed and performs better than the x chart in many situations when the process distribution is skewed or heavy tailed.","[jones-farmer, l. allison] auburn univ, dept management, auburn, al 36849 usa; [jordan, victoria] md anderson canc ctr, houston, tx 77030 usa; [champ, charles w.] georgia so univ, dept math sci, statesboro, ga 30460 usa","jones-farmer, la (reprint author), auburn univ, dept management, auburn, al 36849 usa.","altukife fs, 2003, pak j stat, v19, p291; amin rw, 1995, commun stat theory, v24, p1597, doi 10.1080/03610929508831574; bakir s. t., 2004, quality engineering, v16, p613, doi 10.1081/qen-120038022; bakir st, 2006, commun stat-theor m, v35, p743, doi 10.1080/03610920500498907; bakir st, 1989, commun stat simulat, v18, p757, doi 10.1080/03610918908812789; bakir st, 1979, technometrics, v21, p175, doi 10.2307/1268514; borror cm, 1999, j qual technol, v31, p309; chakraborti s, 2004, j r stat soc c-appl, v53, p443, doi 10.1111/j.1467-9876.2004.0d489.x; chakraborti s, 2001, j qual technol, v33, p304; champ cw, 2004, qual reliab eng int, v20, p497, doi 10.1002/qre.662; champ cw, 2003, qual reliab eng int, v19, p161, doi 10.1002/qre.519; chan lk, 1988, ieee t reliab, v37, p117, doi 10.1109/24.3728; chan lk, 2003, nav res log, v50, p555, doi 10.1002/nav.10077; genz a, 2007, mvndst; hackl p, 1991, j qual technol, v23, p117; hawkins dm, 1987, j roy stat soc d-sta, v36, p299, doi 10.2307/2348827; hawkins dm, 2007, technometrics, v49, p199, doi 10.1198/004017007000000083; jensen wa, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p349; jones la, 2002, qual reliab eng int, v18, p479, doi 10.1002/qre.496; koning aj, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p122; koning aj, 2006, stat neerl, v60, p327, doi 10.1111/j.1467-9574.2006.00335.x; kruskal wh, 1952, j am stat assoc, v47, p583; lucas jm, 1982, commun stat a-theor, v11, p2669, doi 10.1080/03610928208828414; mahmoud ma, 2004, technometrics, v46, p380, doi 10.1198/004017004000000455; montgomery d. c., 2005, intro stat quality c; nedumaran g, 2005, qual reliab eng int, v21, p81, doi 10.1002/qre.609; pappanastos ea, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p213; quesenberry cp, 1991, j qual technol, v23, p213; rocke dm, 1992, statistician, v41, p97, doi 10.2307/2348640; rocke dm, 1989, technometrics, v31, p173, doi 10.2307/1268815; ryan tp, 2000, stat methods quality; sullivan jh, 2002, technometrics, v44, p24, doi 10.1198/004017002753398290; tatum lg, 1997, technometrics, v39, p127, doi 10.2307/1270901; woodall wh, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p341; yashchin e, 1992, technometrics, v34, p54, doi 10.2307/1269552","35","39","40","0","6","taylor & francis inc","2009","304","316","13","jones-farmer, l. allison; jordan, victoria; champ, charles w.","3.55","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","4","2","2","5","7","4","6","4","5","0"

"248","exact calculation of integrated prediction variance for response surface designs on cuboidal and spherical regions","article","design optimality; iv-criterion; region moments; restricted randomization","over the years, design optimality evaluation of response surface designs focused mainly on d-optimality and g-optimality criteria. the apparent limited use of the iv-optimality criterion appears to be influenced by the computational challenges associated with the criterion. the lack of available computer code appears to be the main reason for limited use of the iv-optimality criterion. in addition, the iv-optimality criterion appears more difficult to code than the d-optimality criterion because of the integration required over the specified design region. in this paper, an efficient and exact method is presented for computing the iv-optimality criterion for selected response surface designs. the pseudo-code for the computer program is also presented. the investigation examines both spherical and cuboidal regions of interest. in addition, an analytical approach is outlined for computing the iv-optimality criterion for second-order split-plot designs. a particular feature of the analytical expressions is that they are derived using the design parameters. in addition, several comparisons of second-order response surface designs are illustrated for completely randomized designs and split-plot designs.","[wesley, wayne r.] univ technol, fac engn & comp, kingston 6, jamaica; [simpson, james r.] 53d test management grp, eglin afb, fl usa; [parker, peter a.] nasa, langley res ctr, hampton, va 23681 usa; [pignatiello, joseph j., jr.] florida state univ, dept ind & mfg engn, tallahassee, fl 32310 usa","wesley, wr (reprint author), univ technol, fac engn & comp, kingston 6, jamaica.","borkowski j.j., 2003, j probability stat s, v1, p65; borkowski jj, 2003, j qual technol, v35, p70; borkowski jj, 1995, technometrics, v37, p399, doi 10.2307/1269732; borkowski jj, 2001, technometrics, v43, p468, doi 10.1198/00401700152672564; box gep, 1963, biometrika, v50, p335, doi 10.2307/2333904; box gep, 1959, j am stat assoc, v54, p622; box mj, 1974, technometrics, v16, p613, doi 10.2307/1267614; draper nr, 1998, aust nz j stat, v40, p487, doi 10.1111/1467-842x.00052; giovannittijensen a, 1989, technometrics, v31, p159, doi 10.2307/1268814; goos p, 2001, j qual technol, v33, p436; haines lm, 1987, technometrics, v29, p439; hardin rh, 1993, j stat plan infer, v37, p339, doi 10.1016/0378-3758(93)90112-j; hartley h. o., 1959, biometrics, v15, p611, doi 10.2307/2527658; hoke at, 1974, technometrics, v16, p375, doi 10.2307/1267667; hussey jr, 1987, oper res, v35, p744, doi 10.1287/opre.35.5.744; kiefer j, 1959, ann math stat, v30, p271, doi 10.1214/aoms/1177706252; kiefer j, 1961, ann math stat, v32, p298, doi 10.1214/aoms/1177705160; liang l, 2006, j comput graph stat, v15, p757, doi 10.1198/106186006x157117; lucas jm, 1976, technometrics, v18, p411, doi 10.2307/1268656; lucas jm, 1974, technometrics, v16, p561, doi 10.2307/1267608; myers rh, 1992, j qual technol, v24, p1; notz w, 1982, j stat plan infer, v6, p47, doi 10.1016/0378-3758(82)90055-6; ozol-godfrey a, 2005, j qual technol, v37, p223; park yj, 2005, j qual technol, v37, p253; parker pa, 2006, qual reliab eng int, v22, p291, doi 10.1002/qre.771; parker pa, 2007, technometrics, v49, p56, doi 10.1198/004017006000000462; roquemore kg, 1976, technometrics, v18, p419; vining gg, 2005, j qual technol, v37, p115; wesley wr, 2009, commun stat-theor m, v38, p90, doi 10.1080/03610920802162797","29","1","1","0","4","taylor & francis inc","2009","165","180","16","wesley, wayne r.; simpson, james r.; parker, peter a.; pignatiello, joseph j., jr.","0.09","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"

"250","statistical process monitoring of nonlinear profiles using wavelets","article","average run length; change point; control charts likelihood ratio; nonlinear; semiparametric; statistical process control; wavelet thresholding","many modern industrial processes are capable of generating rich and complex data records that do not readily permit the use of traditional statistical process-control techniques. for example, a ""single observation"" from a process might consist of n pairs of (x, y) data that can be described as y = f(x) when the process is in control. such data structures or relationships between y and x are called profiles. examples of profiles include calibration curves in chemical processing, oxide thickness across wafer surfaces in semiconductor manufacturing, and radar signals of military targets. in this paper, a semiparametric wavelet method is proposed for monitoring for changes in sequences of nonlinear profiles. based on a likelihood ratio test involving a changepoint model, the method uses the spatial-adaptivity properties of wavelets to accurately detect profile changes taking nearly limitless functional forms. the method is used to differentiate between different radar profiles and its performance is assessed with monte carlo simulation. the results presented indicate the method can quickly detect a wide variety of changes from a given, in-control profile.","[chicken, eric] florida state univ, dept stat, tallahassee, fl 32306 usa; [pignatiello, joseph, jr.] florida state univ, dept ind & mfg engn, tallahassee, fl 32306 usa; usaf, test management grp 53, eglin afb, fl 32542 usa","chicken, e (reprint author), florida state univ, dept stat, tallahassee, fl 32306 usa.","cai tt, 1999, ann stat, v27, p898, doi 10.1214/aos/1018031262; chicken e, 2005, j multivariate anal, v95, p76, doi 10.1016/j.jmva.2004.07.003; chicken e, 2005, j nonparametr stat, v17, p467, doi 10.1080/10485250500039262; chicken e, 2003, j stat plan infer, v116, p113, doi 10.1016/s0378-3758(02)00238-0; chicken e, 2006, m976 flor stat u dep; colosimo bm, 2008, j qual technol, v40, p1; daubechies i., 1992, 10 lect wavelets; ding y, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p199; donoho dl, 1994, biometrika, v81, p425, doi 10.1093/biomet/81.3.425; donoho dl, 1995, j am stat assoc, v90, p1200, doi 10.2307/2291512; fan jq, 1996, j am stat assoc, v91, p674, doi doi 10.1080/01621459.1996.10476936; feller w, 1968, intro probability th, v1; gardner m, 1997, ieee t components c, v20, p294; jeong mk, 2006, int j prod res, v44, p729, doi 10.1080/00207540500222647; jin j, 2001, j intell manuf, v12, p140; jin jh, 1999, technometrics, v41, p327, doi 10.2307/1271349; johnson l.w., 1982, numerical anal; kang l, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p418; kim k, 2003, j qual technol, v35, p317; mahmoud ma, 2007, qual reliab eng int, v23, p247, doi 10.1002/qre.788; mallat s., 1999, wavelet tour signal; mallat sg, 1989, t am math soc, v315, p69, doi 10.2307/2001373; montgomery d. c., 2005, intro stat quality c; ogden rt, 1997, essential wavelets s; stover fs, 1998, j chromatogr a, v804, p37, doi 10.1016/s0021-9673(98)00094-6; vidakovic b., 1999, stat modeling wavele; williams jd, 2007, qual reliab eng int, v23, p925, doi 10.1002/qre.858; woodall wh, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p309; zou cl, 2006, iie trans, v38, p1093, doi 10.1080/07408170600728913","29","53","55","0","13","taylor & francis inc","2009","198","212","15","chicken, eric; pignatiello, joseph, jr.; simpson, james r.","4.82","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","3","7","5","2","7","7","10","9","1"

"259","experimental design considerations for accelerated life tests with nonlinear constraints and censoring","article","d-optimality; experimental design; reliability; solder joint reliability; temperature cycle","problem: as the electronic industry has adopted lead-free solder joint technology, the failure acceleration model for solder joint fatigue needs to be reinvestigated through accelerated life tests (alt). however, traditional alt designs currently employed by the industry fail to provide sufficient information for this purpose. approach: this paper explores criteria for effectively planning alt. it addresses the problem by hypothesizing a model form, deriving the model parameters using real data, and simulating alt results for different experimental design plans. relative comparisons are drawn between the influence of experimental design selection and some traditional reliability test plan variables such as sample size, censoring scheme, and sample allocation. results: we find that the importance of selecting an experimental design exceeds the importance usually given to the selection of sample size and censoring scheme, or to the choice of a test unit allocation strategy in the context of a reliability test case study. d-optimal-based designs provide good performance for acceleration model validation, especially when the testing feasibility region is asymmetric. d-optimal designs offer an eightfold reduction in sample size over legacy designs for a fixed precision. alternatively, d-optimal designs yield a 3.5x increase in parameter estimate precision over legacy designs for a fixed sample size. numerical simulations confirm that legacy designs provide insufficient precision to determine if two or three model parameters are significant.","[monroe, eric m.] intel corp, chandler, az 85226 usa; [pan, rong] arizona state univ, tempe, az usa","monroe, em (reprint author), intel corp, chandler, az 85226 usa.","[anonymous], 2005, jesd22a104c jedec so; blish richard, 1999, use condition based; clech jp, 2005, lead free solder int, pch4; coffin jlf, 1954, t asme, v76, p931; darveaux r, 1997, p tms ann m, p213; engelmaier w, 1984, ishm technical monog, p87; escobar la, 1995, technometrics, v37, p411, doi 10.2307/1269733; guo h., 2007, p ieee int c ind eng, p1 236; *jedec, 2004, jesd22a105c jedec so; manson ss, 1953, nacatn2933 nasa lew; mencinger np, 2000, assembly technology; ng hkt, 2007, nav res log, v54, p237, doi 10.1002/nav.20207; norris kc, 1969, ibm j res dev, v13, p266, doi 10.1147/rd.133.0266; onar a, 2004, j stat plan infer, v119, p411, doi 10.1016/s0378-3758(02)00489-5; pan n, 2005, surface mount techno; park jw, 1996, nav res log, v43, p863, doi 10.1002/(sici)1520-6750(199609)43:6<863::aid-nav5>3.0.co;2-2; sahasrabudhe s, 2003, p el comp techn c, v53, p898; syed a, 2001, ieee 51 el comp tech, p255; tang lc, 1999, nav res log, v46, p169, doi 10.1002/(sici)1520-6750(199903)46:2<169::aid-nav3>3.0.co;2-u; tang lc, 2002, p a rel mai, p338, doi 10.1109/rams.2002.981664; zhao wb, 2005, qual reliab eng int, v21, p701, doi 10.1002/qre.709","21","6","6","0","5","amer soc quality control-asqc","2008","355","367","13","monroe, eric m.; pan, rong","0.5","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","2","1","1","0","0","1","0"

"264","robustness comparison of exponentially weighted moving-average charts on autocorrelated data and on residuals","article","autoregressive moving-average model; control chart; model error; robustness; statistical process control","control charting of autocorrelated data has been the subject of extensive research over the past two decades. a standard approach is to apply an exponentially weighted moving average (ewma) chart to either the autocorrelated data or to the residuals of an autoregressive moving-average (arma) model of the process. numerous empirical studies have demonstrated that many control charts for autocorrelated data, residual-based charts in particular, lack robustness to arma modeling errors. in this article, we quantify and corroborate these empirical findings by developing analytical expressions for the sensitivity of ewma control charts applied to residuals and to autocorrelated data. the analytical results provide insight into the mechanisms behind the (lack of) robustness and also provide a basis for comparing the robustness of the two approaches. one conclusion is that, although the residual-based ewma may lack robustness, it is generally more robust than the ewma applied to the autocorrelated data.","[apley, daniel w.] northwestern univ, evanston, il 60208 usa; [lee, hyun cheol] samsung elect, qual assurance dept, samsung elect semicond business, hwasung city 445701, gyeonggi do, south korea","apley, dw (reprint author), northwestern univ, evanston, il 60208 usa.","adams bm, 1998, j qual technol, v30, p328; alwan lc, 1992, commun stat theory, v21, p1025, doi 10.1080/03610929208830829; alwan lc, 1988, j bus econ stat, v6, p87, doi 10.2307/1391421; apley dw, 2007, j qual technol, v39, p93; apley dw, 2003, technometrics, v45, p187, doi 10.1198/004017003000000014; apley dw, 2002, j manuf sci e-t asme, v124, p891, doi 10.1115/1.1510520; apley dw, 1999, iie trans, v31, p1123, doi 10.1080/07408179908969913; apley dw, 2008, effects model unpub; astrom karl j., 1990, computer controlled; berthouex pm, 1978, j qual technol, v10, p139; box gep, 1994, time series anal; chin ch, 2006, technometrics, v48, p337, doi 10.1198/004017006000000020; del castillo e, 2002, stat process adjustm; english jr, 2000, iie trans, v32, p1103, doi 10.1023/a:1007623715556; harris tj, 1991, can j chem eng, v69, p48, doi 10.1002/cjce.5450690106; johnson ra, 1974, technometrics, v16, p103, doi 10.2307/1267498; kramer h, 1997, nonlinear anal-theor, v30, p4007, doi 10.1016/s0362-546x(97)00278-2; kramer h, 2000, stat pap, v41, p173, doi 10.1007/bf02926102; lee hc, 2004, thesis texas a m u; lin wsw, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p289; lu cw, 1999, j qual technol, v31, p166; lu cw, 2001, j qual technol, v33, p316; lucas jm, 1990, technometrics, v32, p1, doi 10.2307/1269835; montgomery dc, 1997, j qual technol, v29, p121; montgomery dc, 1991, j qual technol, v23, p179; pandit sm, 1990, time series system a; robert s. w., 1959, technometrics, v1, p239, doi doi 10.1080/00401706.1959.10489860; runger gc, 1995, commun stat theory, v24, p273, doi 10.1080/03610929508831487; schmid w, 1997, ann stat, v25, p1277; schmid w., 1997, frontiers stat quali, v5, p115, doi doi 10.1007/978-3-642-59239-3_10; schone a, 1999, j stat plan infer, v79, p289, doi 10.1016/s0378-3758(98)00260-2; stoumbos zg, 2000, j am stat assoc, v95, p992, doi 10.2307/2669484; superville cr, 1994, commun stat simulat, v23, p645, doi 10.1080/03610919408813191; vanderwiel sa, 1996, technometrics, v38, p139, doi 10.1080/00401706.1996.10484459; vasilopoulos av, 1978, j qual technol, v10, p20; wardell dg, 1994, technometrics, v36, p3, doi 10.2307/1269191; woodall wh, 1999, j qual technol, v31, p376; zhang nf, 1998, technometrics, v40, p24, doi 10.2307/1271390","38","7","7","0","2","amer soc quality control-asqc","2008","428","447","20","apley, daniel w.; lee, hyun cheol","0.58","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","3","2","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","0"

"280","weighted cusum chart for detecting patterned mean shifts","article","automatic process control; change-point detection; ewma; statistical process control","most conventional control charts focus on detecting a constant mean shift. in reality, however, it is often important to deal with situations where the mean of the monitoring sequence has a dynamic shift pattern, e.g., residuals from a time series. in these cases, the conventional control charts may perform poorly, as they do not consider the information due to what is known as ""forecast recovery"" contained in the patterned mean shift. this paper proposes a new weighted cumulative sum (wcusum) procedure for monitoring a sequence with a patterned mean shift. this method first estimates the dynamic mean of the sequence, then uses the estimates for weighting the incremental in the conventional cusum chart. guidelines for designing the wcusum chart are proposed, and the performance is compared with that of the conventional cusum chart and other alternatives for detecting patterned mean shifts. it is found that the wcusum chart performs far superior to other charts for detecting small to moderate shifts when forecast recovery is present and performs competitively otherwise.","[shu, lianjie] univ macau, fac business adm, taipa, peoples r china; [jiang, wei] stevens inst technol, dept syst engn & engn management, hoboken, nj 07030 usa; [tsui, kwok-leung] georgia inst technol, sch ind & syst engn, atlanta, ga 30332 usa","shu, lj (reprint author), univ macau, fac business adm, av padre tomas pereira sj, taipa, peoples r china.","alwan lc, 1988, j bus econ stat, v6, p87, doi 10.2307/1391421; apley dw, 1999, iie trans, v31, p1123, doi 10.1080/07408179908969913; basseville m, 1993, detection abrupt cha; box g, 1992, technometrics, v34, p251, doi 10.2307/1270028; box ge, 1976, time series anal; box gep, 1992, quality reliability, v8, p17; brook d, 1972, biometrika, v59, p539; hu sj, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p302; hunter js, 1986, j qual technol, v18, p203; jiang w, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p367; jiang w, 2002, j qual technol, v34, p384; lin wsw, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p289; lu cw, 1999, j qual technol, v31, p166; lu cw, 2001, j qual technol, v33, p316; lucas jm, 1982, technometrics, v24, p199, doi 10.2307/1268679; lucas jm, 1990, technometrics, v32, p1, doi 10.2307/1269835; luceno a, 1999, comput stat data an, v32, p177, doi 10.1016/s0167-9473(99)00025-0; luceno a, 2004, quality technology q, v1, p27; moustakides gv, 1986, ann stat, v14, p1379, doi 10.1214/aos/1176350164; runcer cc, 2003, quality reliability, v19, p387; runger gc, 1996, j am stat assoc, v91, p1701, doi 10.2307/2291599; shao ye, 1998, stat sinica, v8, p239; shewhart w.a., 1931, ec control quality m; shu lj, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p135; sparks rs, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p157; superville cr, 1994, commun stat simulat, v23, p645, doi 10.1080/03610919408813191; tsung fg, 2003, iie trans, v35, p231, doi 10.1080/07408170390175468; vanderwiel sa, 1996, technometrics, v38, p139, doi 10.1080/00401706.1996.10484459; vanderwiel sa, 1992, technometrics, v34, p286; wardell dg, 1994, technometrics, v36, p3, doi 10.2307/1269191; yashchin e, 1993, technometrics, v35, p37, doi 10.2307/1269288; yashchin e, 1989, technometrics, v31, p321, doi 10.2307/3556142; yashchin e, 1995, technometrics, v37, p311, doi 10.2307/1269915","33","20","20","0","11","taylor & francis inc","2008","194","213","20","shu, lianjie; jiang, wei; tsui, kwok-leung","1.67","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","3","4","3","4","1","2","0","0","0","2","0"

"283","statistical process control for geometric specifications: on the monitoring of roundness profiles","article","control charts; geometric tolerance; multivariate control chart; profile monitoring; regression; spatial statistics; spc","quality of mechanical components is critically related to both dimensional and geometric specifications. traditionally, approaches for statistical process control (spc) focused on the first type of specification only. when the quality of a manufactured product is related to geometric specifications (e.g., profile and form tolerances as straightness, roundness, cylindricity, flatness, etc.), the process should be considered in control if the relationship used to represent that profile or surface in the space is stable over time. this paper presents a novel method for monitoring bidimensional profiles. the proposed method is based on combining a spatial autoregressive regression (sarx) model (i.e., a regression model with spatial autoregressive errors) with control charting. to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, the approach is applied to real process data in which the roundness of items obtained by turning has to be monitored. a simulation study indicates that the proposed approach outperforms competing methods (based on monitoring the out-of-roundness value for each profile) in terms of the average number of samples required to detect out-of-control conditions arising in phase 11 and due to spindle-motion errors.","[colosimo, bianca m.; semeraro, quirico] politecn milan, dept mech engn, i-20133 milan, italy; [semeraro, quirico] politecn milan, fac ind engn, i-20133 milan, italy; [pacella, massimo] univ salento, dept ingn innovaz, i-73100 lecce, italy","colosimo, bm (reprint author), politecn milan, dept mech engn, piazza leonardo da vinci 32, i-20133 milan, italy.","box gep, 1994, time series anal; capello e, 1999, int j mach tool manu, v39, p55, doi 10.1016/s0890-6955(98)00022-4; capello e, 2001, int j mach tool manu, v41, p1071, doi 10.1016/s0890-6955(01)00019-0; carr k, 1995, precis eng, v17, p144, doi 10.1016/0141-6359(94)00018-u; chang h, 1993, int j prod res, v31, p2079, doi 10.1080/00207549308956845; cho n, 2001, precis eng, v25, p35, doi 10.1016/s0141-6359(00)00053-2; chou sy, 1994, j design manufacturi, v4, p253; colosimo b.m., 2004, p ifac c man mod man; colosimo bm, 2007, qual reliab eng int, v23, p707, doi 10.1002/qre.878; cressie n. a. c., 1993, stat spatial data; crowder sv, 1992, j qual technol, v24, p112; del castillo e, 2002, stat process adjustm; ding y, 2006, j qual technol, v38, p199; fan c, 2003, j manuf sci e-t asme, v125, p77, doi 10.1115/1.1537739; flott lw, 1998, metal finishing  aug, p47; fung ehk, 2002, ieee t contr syst t, v10, p902, doi 10.1109/tcst.2002.804125; fung ehk, 1999, appl math model, v23, p567, doi 10.1016/s0307-904x(98)10100-2; fung ehk, 2000, int j adv manuf tech, v16, p404, doi 10.1007/s001700050172; gass si, 1998, int j flex manuf sys, v10, p5, doi 10.1023/a:1007996916604; *gps, 213 tc iso; gupta s, 2006, j production res, v44, p1927; henke rp, 1999, precis eng, v23, p273, doi 10.1016/s0141-6359(99)00023-9; hii kf, 2004, precis eng, v28, p204, doi 10.1016/j.precisioneng.2003.11.001; jin jh, 1999, technometrics, v41, p327, doi 10.2307/1271349; jin jh, 2001, j intell manuf, v12, p257, doi 10.1023/a:1011248925750; kang l, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p418; kim k, 2003, j qual technol, v35, p317; kim k, 1987, t asme, v109, p291; kim kh, 1987, t asme, v109, p385; lesage jp, 1999, theory practise spat; li cj, 1992, j eng ind-t asme, v114, p476; liang sy, 2004, j manuf sci e-t asme, v126, p297, doi 10.1115/1.1707035; mahmoud ma, 2004, technometrics, v46, p380, doi 10.1198/004017004000000455; park cw, 1988, int j mach tool manu, v28, p59, doi 10.1016/0890-6955(88)90007-7; park cw, 1988, t asme, v110, p263; sakia rm, 1992, j roy stat soc d-sta, v41, p169, doi 10.2307/2348250; spitzner dj, 2003, p am stat ass, p225; stover fs, 1998, j chromatogr a, v804, p37, doi 10.1016/s0021-9673(98)00094-6; sullivan jh, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p398; vargas nja, 2003, j qual technol, v35, p367; walker e, 2002, j qual technol, v34, p118; whittle p, 1954, biometrika, v41, p434; williams jd, 2007, quality reliability; williams jf, 2002, issues stud, v38-9, p217; woodall wh, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p309; young tm, 1999, forest prod j, v49, p79; zhu lm, 2003, comput aided design, v35, p255, doi 10.1016/s0010-4485(01)00210-x; zou cl, 2006, iie trans, v38, p1093, doi 10.1080/07408170600728913","48","64","65","1","9","amer soc quality control-asqc","2008","1","18","18","colosimo, bianca m.; semeraro, quirico; pacella, massimo","5.33","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","2","8","10","1","5","9","10","3","9","6","0"

"287","using hierarchical probability models to evaluate robust parameter design methods","article","combined array; product array; response modeling; signal-to-noise ratio","an approach is proposed for evaluating the effectiveness of robust parameter design methods. a hierarchical probability model is presented that enables an investigator to represent assumptions about regularities in system responses such as effect sparsity, hierarchy, and inheritance. the hierarchical probability model is used to create a population of responses to which alternative robust parameter design methods are applied. in a model-based study, product arrays and combined arrays are both applied in simulations of a scenario similar to that in a physical experiment recently published in the literature. the study confirmed the result found in the physical experiment that, in scenarios of this form, product arrays with classical analysis can exploit effects on transmitted variance that interaction analysis and combined arrays often cannot. the model-based approach also enabled investigation into mechanisms by which robust design methods function and into the assumptions critical to their effectiveness.","[frey, daniel d.; li, xiang] mit, dept mech engn, cambridge, ma 02139 usa; [frey, daniel d.] mit, engn syst div, cambridge, ma 02139 usa","frey, dd (reprint author), mit, dept mech engn, 77 massachusetts ave, cambridge, ma 02139 usa.","borror cm, 2000, qual reliab eng int, v16, p117, doi 10.1002/(sici)1099-1638(200003/04)16:2<117::aid-qre309>3.0.co;2-0; box g, 1988, technometrics, v30, p1, doi 10.2307/1270311; box gep, 1986, technometrics, v28, p11, doi 10.2307/1269599; box gep, 1999, j qual technol, v31, p16; box gep, 1985, j qual technol, v17, p189; chipman h, 1997, technometrics, v39, p372, doi 10.2307/1271501; chipman h, 1996, can j stat, v24, p17, doi 10.2307/3315687; daniel c, 1959, technometrics, v1, p311, doi doi 10.1080/00401706.1959.10489866; easterbrook pj, 1991, lancet, v337, p867, doi 10.1016/0140-6736(91)90201-y; frey dd, 2006, technometrics, v48, p418, doi 10.1198/004017006000000075; frey dd, 2006, res eng des, v17, p45, doi 10.1007/s00163-006-0016-4; frey dd, 2008, in press asme j mech; hamada m, 1992, j qual technol, v24, p130; kackar rn, 1985, j qual technol, v17, p176; kunert j, 2007, j qual technol, v39, p17; lenth rv, 1989, technometrics, v31, p469, doi 10.2307/1269997; li xa, 2006, complexity, v11, p32, doi 10.1002/cplx.20123; lucas jm, 1994, j qual technol, v26, p248; lucas jm, 1989, p am stat ass sesq i, p579; morrison s. j., 1957, applied statistics, v6, p133; nair vn, 1992, technometrics, v34, p127, doi 10.2307/1269231; pareto v, 1893, cours ec politique; phadke ms, 1989, quality eng using ro; rosenbaum pr, 1996, technometrics, v38, p354, doi 10.2307/1271306; rosenbaum pr, 1994, j roy stat soc b met, v56, p641; shoemaker ac, 1991, technometrics, v33, p415, doi 10.2307/1269414; steinberg dm, 1994, j qual technol, v26, p12; taguchi g, 1985, intro offline qualit; vining gg, 1990, j qual technol, v22, p38; welch wj, 1990, j qual technol, v22, p15; wu cfj, 2003, stat sinica, v13, p1179; wu cfj, 2000, expt planning anal p","32","5","6","2","4","taylor & francis inc","2008","59","77","19","frey, daniel d.; li, xiang","0.42","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","1","0"

"310","optimal monitoring of multivariate data for fault patterns","article","control charts; multivariate quality control; profile monitoring; spc; statistical process control","a process-oriented basis representation can be used to express multivariate quality vectors as linear combinations of fault patterns, plus a residual. monitoring the estimated coefficients of the linear relationship is especially useful when the quality vector contains measurements of the same unit at different locations on a part or other types of profile data. to use process-oriented methods for monitoring changes in the mean of the quality vector, one needs to identify whether the effects occur only as special causes or also as common causes of variation. the calculation of process-oriented model coefficients is shown for each case. in general, the coefficients must be computed by weighted least squares, but we show that, in some circumstances, the ordinary least squares estimates are equivalent. in such cases, charting the proposed u-2 statistic is equivalent to charting a t-2 statistic computed from the process-oriented coefficients, making the process-oriented statistical process control (spc) statistic optimal in the sense of being most powerful for detecting mean shifts in the process-oriented space. when there are fewer cause-related patterns than the number of elements in the quality vector, the process-oriented basis is incomplete. in this case, the spc methods are applied in a subspace of the original quality vector space. for some practical examples, it is shown that the process-oriented basis representation approach yields substantially better average run-length performance compared with the usual t-2 chart applied to the original quality vectors.","arizona state univ, dept ind engn, tempe, az 85287 usa;

shewhart chart; statistical process control","control charts are powerful tools used to monitor the quality of processes. in practice, control chart limits are often calculated using parameter estimates from an in-control phase i reference sample. in phase ii of the monitoring scheme, statistics based on new samples are compared with the estimated control limits to monitor for departures from the in-control state. many studies that evaluate control chart performance in phase ii rely on the assumption that the in-control parameters are known. although the additional variability introduced into the monitoring scheme through parameter estimation is known to affect the chart performance, many studies do not consider the effect of estimation on the performance of the chart. this paper contains a review of the literature that explicitly considers the effect of parameter estimation on control chart properties. some recommendations are made and future research ideas in this area are provided.","wl gore & assoc inc, med prod div, flagstaff, az 86003 usa;

"323","phase i analysis for monitoring nonlinear profiles in manufacturing processes","article","change-point detection; clustering; control chart; multivariate analysis","phase i analysis of nonlinear profiles aims at identifying the data from an in-control process as accurately as possible so that quality engineers can have a good reference to establish the control charts for a future process. unlike linear profiles, which can be represented by a linear regression model with its model parameters used for monitoring and detection, nonlinear profiles are often sampled into high-dimensional data vectors and analyzed by nonparametric methods. meanwhile, automatic in-process data-collection devices generate huge historical data sets, which must be analyzed for the presence of observations from out-of-control process conditions. the high dimensionality and data contamination present a challenge to the phase i analysis of nonlinear profiles. this paper presents a strategy that consists of two major components: a data-reduction component that projects the original data into a lower dimension subspace while preserving the data-clustering structure and a data-separation technique that can detect single and multiple shifts as well as outliers in the data. simulated data sets as well as nonlinear profile signals from a forging process are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.","texas a&m univ, dept ind & syst engn, college stn, tx 77843 usa; univ wisconsin, dept ind & syst engn, madison, wi 53706 usa","ding, y (reprint author), texas a&m univ, dept ind & syst engn, college stn, tx 77843 usa.","apley dw, 2001, technometrics, v43, p84, doi 10.1198/00401700152404354; bakshi br, 1998, aiche j, v44, p1596, doi 10.1002/aic.690440712; barnett k, 1998, j mat manufacturing, v107, p991; carreira-perpinan m., 1997, cs9609 u sheff dep c; fraley c, 2002, j am stat assoc, v97, p611, doi 10.1198/016214502760047131; gelman a, 2003, bayesian data anal; golub g. h., 1996, matrix computations; huber pj, 1985, ann stat, v13, p435, doi 10.1214/aos/1176349519; hyvarinen a., 2001, independent componen; jackson j. e., 1991, users guide principa; jin j, 2001, j intell manuf, v12, p267; jin jh, 1999, technometrics, v41, p327, doi 10.2307/1271349; johnson r, 2002, appl multivariate st; jones mc, 1987, j roy stat soc a sta, v150, p1, doi 10.2307/2981662; knussmann kd, 1993, signature based proc; koh ckh, 1999, j manuf sci e-t asme, v121, p290, doi 10.1115/1.2831218; koh ckh, 1999, j manuf sci e-t asme, v121, p295, doi 10.1115/1.2831219; kosanovich ka, 1997, intell data anal, v1, p85; lada ek, 2002, ieee t semiconduct m, v15, p79, doi 10.1109/66.983447; mahmoud ma, 2004, technometrics, v46, p380, doi 10.1198/004017004000000455; mclachlan g.j., 2000, finite mixture model; montgomery d. c, 2004, intro stat quality c; pittner s, 1999, ieee t pattern anal, v21, p83, doi 10.1109/34.745739; ramsey jo, 2002, appl functional data; runger gc, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p313; runger gc, 2005, in press j quality t; sullivan jh, 2002, j qual technol, v34, p371; wilkinson jh, 1965, algebraic eigenvalue; zhou s, 2005, iie trans, v37, p569, doi 10.1080/07408170590929036; zhou s, 2004, in press ieee t auto","30","130","134","2","15","taylor & francis inc","2006","199","216","18","ding, yu; zeng, li; zhou, shiyu","9.29","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","5","5","7","10","9","12","7","18","15","9","18","14","1"
"324","distribution of hotelling's t-2 statistic based on the successive differences estimator","article","approximate distribution; false alarm rate; multivariate spc; sample size; t-2 control chart","in the historical (or retrospective or phase i) multivariate data analysis, the choice of the estimator for the variance-covariance matrix is crucial to successfully detecting the presence of special causes of variation. for the case of individual multivariate observations, the choice is compounded by the lack of rational subgroups of observations with the same distribution. other research has shown that the use of the sample covariance matrix, with all of the individual observations pooled, impairs the detection of a sustained step shift in the mean vector. for example, research has shown that, with the use of the sample covariance matrix, the probability of a signal actually decreases below the false-alarm probability with a sustained step shift near the middle of the data and that the signal probability decreases with the size of the shift. an alternative estimator, based on the successive differences of the individual observations, leads to an increasing signal probability as the size of the step shift increases and has been recommended for use in phase i analysis. however, the exact distribution for the resulting t-2 chart statistics has not been determined when the successive differences estimator is used. three approximate distributions have been proposed in the literature. in this paper, we demonstrate several useful properties of the t-2 statistics based on the successive differences estimator and give a more accurate approximate distribution for calculating the upper control limit for individual observations in a phase i analysis.","ge global res, appl stat lab, niskayuna, ny 12309 usa; virginia polytech inst & state univ, dept stat, blacksburg, va 24061 usa; mississippi state univ, mississippi state, ms 39762 usa","williams, jd (reprint author), ge global res, appl stat lab, niskayuna, ny 12309 usa.","chou ym, 1999, commun stat-simul c, v28, p1031, doi 10.1080/03610919908813591; chou ym, 2001, communications sta a, v30, p937; fuchs c, 1998, multivariate quality; gnanadesikan r, 1972, biometrics, v28, p81, doi 10.2307/2528963; hawkins dm, 1974, j am stat assoc, v69, p340, doi 10.2307/2285654; hawkins dm, 1974, math geol, v6, p263; holmes ds, 1993, qual eng, v5, p619, doi doi 10.1080/08982119308919004; lowry ca, 1995, iie trans, v27, p800, doi 10.1080/07408179508936797; mahmoud m. a., 2004, technometrics, v46, p377; mason rl, 2003, j qual technol, v35, p47; mason rl, 2002, multivariate stat pr; nedumaran g, 1999, iie trans, v31, p529; prins j., 1997, quality eng, v10, p49; quesenberry c.p., 2001, qual eng, v13, p679; rencher a. c., 2000, linear models stat; sullivan jh, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p398; sullivan jh, 2002, j qual technol, v34, p374; vargas nja, 2003, j qual technol, v35, p367; wilks s., 1963, sankhya a, v4, p407; williams j. d., 2004, 045 virg pol i stat; woodall wh, 1992, commun stat theory, v21, p3211, doi 10.1080/03610929208830972; woodall wh, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p309","22","51","52","0","3","amer soc quality control-asqc","2006","217","229","13","williams, james d.; woodall, william h.; birch, jeffrey b.; sullivan, joe h.","3.64","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","3","5","7","6","3","3","7","4","2","2","4","5","0"

"326","permutation methods for comparing process capabilities","article","bonferroni; bootstrap; multiple comparisons; p-value; randomization","the statistical comparison of competing manufacturing processes is an important aspect of statistical quality control that aids quality managers in the choice of potential suppliers of products, manufacturing methodologies, or proposed adjustments to the manufacturing process. the selection criteria, in the absence of considerations such as cost, is based on a quality metric, such as the capability of each manufacturing process. because quality metrics are estimated based on sample process data, the inherent variability in the estimates must be accounted for when selecting the best manufacturing process. in this paper, we consider solutions to this problem based on permutation testing methodology. in the case of two processes, the methodology is based on a simple permutation test of the null hypothesis that the two processes have equal capability. in the case of more than two processes, multiple-comparison techniques are used in conjunction with the proposed permutation tests. the advantage of using the permutation methods is that the significance levels of the permutation tests are exact regardless of the distribution of the process data. the methodology is demonstrated using several examples, and the potential performance of the methods are investigated empirically.","no illinois univ, div stat, de kalb, il 60115 usa","polansky, am (reprint author), no illinois univ, div stat, de kalb, il 60115 usa.","chan lk, 1988, j qual technol, v20, p162; chen jp, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p329; chou ym, 1991, commun stat theory, v20, p2357, doi 10.1080/03610929108830638; chou ym, 1994, qual eng, v6, p427, doi doi 10.1080/08982119408918738; christensen h., 1996, plane answers comple; daniels l, 2005, qual eng, v17, p23, doi doi 10.1081/qen-200028666; davison ac, 1997, bootstrap methods th, p159; efron b, 1993, intro bootstrap, p202; garthwaite ph, 1996, biometrics, v52, p1387, doi 10.2307/2532852; hsiang tc, 1985, asa ann m las veg ne; huang dy, 1995, j stat plan infer, v46, p335, doi 10.1016/0378-3758(94)00114-b; hubele nf, 2005, j qual technol, v37, p304; kane ve, 1986, j qual technol, v18, p41; kotz s, 1993, process capability i; manly bfj, 1997, randomization bootst, p3; maritz js, 1995, distribution free st, p79; marron js, 1992, ann stat, v20, p712, doi 10.1214/aos/1176348653; mason rl, 1989, stat design anal exp; polansky am, 2003, handb stat, v22, p625, doi 10.1016/s0169-7161(03)22019-8; polansky am, 2003, int j reliability qu, v10, p1; tseng st, 1991, j qual technol, v23, p53","21","10","10","0","3","amer soc quality control-asqc","2006","254","266","13","polansky, alan m.","0.71","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","1","0","3","1","2","1","0","0"

"328","bayesian tolerance intervals for the unbalanced one-way random effects model","article","bayesian procedure; monte carlo simulation; predictive density; probability matching prior; random effects; reference prior; tolerance intervals","statistical intervals, properly calculated from sample data, are likely to be substantially more informative to decision makers than obtaining a point estimate alone and are often of paramount interest to practitioners and thus management (and are usually a great deal more meaningful than statistical significance or hypothesis tests). in this note, a simulation-based approach for determining bayesian tolerance intervals in an unbalanced one-way random effects model is illustrated. reference and probability matching priors are first derived for a more general mixed linear model from which the priors for beta, sigma(2)(epsilon), and nu in the case of the random effects model follow easily, where beta is the grand mean, sigma(2)(epsilon) is the variance of random errors, and nu = sigma(2)(gamma)/sigma(2)(epsilon) is the ratio of the random effect to noise variances. a tensile-strength example illustrates the flexibility and unique features of the bayesian simulation method for the construction of tolerance intervals. although this example has only one random effect, the method can be applied similarly to other unbalanced data sets and models with multiple variance components. in the last section, a procedure is discussed to obtain bayesian tolerance intervals for the three-component balanced hierarchical design model.","univ orange free state, dept math sci, za-9300 bloemfontein, south africa; univ orange free state, dept math, za-9300 bloemfontein, south africa","van der merwe, aj (reprint author), univ orange free state, dept math sci, pob 339, za-9300 bloemfontein, south africa.","aitchison j, 1966, j r stat soc b, v28, p57; aitchison j, 1964, j roy stat soc b, v26, p161; aitchison j., 1975, stat prediction anal; arnold b. f., 1990, zor, methods and models of operations research, v34, p59, doi 10.1007/bf01415951; berger j o, 1992, bayesian statistics, v4, p35; box gep, 1973, bayesian inference s; datta gs, 1995, biometrika, v82, p37, doi 10.2307/2337625; gelfand ae, 1991, commun stat theory, v20, p1747, doi 10.1080/03610929108830595; guttman i, 2003, test, v12, p115, doi 10.1007/bf02595814; guttman i., 1970, stat tolerance regio; hahn g. j, 1991, stat intervals; laubscher nf, 1996, s afr stat j, v30, p27; rice aj, 1995, math stat data anal; shewhart wa, 1980, ec control quality m; tierney l, 1994, ann stat, v22, p1701, doi 10.1214/aos/1176325750; vandermerwe aj, 2000, 286 rsa u free stat; vandermerwe aj, 2003, 328 rsa u free stat; vangel mg, 1992, technometrics, v34, p176, doi 10.2307/1269233; vangel mg, 1994, spring res c stat in; wang cm, 1994, technometrics, v36, p162, doi 10.2307/1270228; wolfinger rd, 2000, biometrics, v56, p768, doi 10.1111/j.0006-341x.2000.00768.x; wolfinger rd, 1998, j qual technol, v30, p18; woodward p. w., 1993, statistician, v42, p461; yang ry, 1995, j multivariate anal, v55, p283, doi 10.1006/jmva.1995.1080; ye ky, 1994, j stat plan infer, v41, p267, doi 10.1016/0378-3758(94)90023-x","25","5","5","2","4","taylor & francis inc","2006","280","293","14","van der merwe, abraham j.; pretorius, albertus l.; meyer, johannes h.","0.36","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","0","0","1","0","0","1","0","0","1","0"

"338","split-plot fractional designs: is minimum aberration enough?","article","design criterion; restriction on randomization; robust design; sequential processes","split-plot experiments are commonly used in industry for product and process improvement. recent articles on designing split-plot experiments concentrate on minimum aberration as the design criterion. minimum aberration has been criticized as a design criterion for completely randomized fractional factorial design and alternative criteria, such as the maximum number of clear two-factor interactions, are suggested (wu and hamada (2000)). the need for alternatives to minimum aberration is even more acute for split-plot designs. in a standard split-plot design, there are several types of two-factor interactions, not all of them equally interesting. however, minimum aberration is not designed to distinguish among the different types of two-factor interactions. it should be noted that this criticism is valid not only for the minimum aberration but also for any other design criteria originally proposed for completely randomized designs. consequently, we provide a modified version of the maximum number of clear two-factor interactions design criterion to be used for split-plot designs.","arizona state univ, dept ind engn, tempe, az 85287 usa; wl gore & assoc inc, elkton, md 21922 usa; sas inst inc, linear models r&d, cary, nc 27513 usa","kulahci, m (reprint author), arizona state univ, dept ind engn, tempe, az 85287 usa.","addelman s, 1964, technometrics, v6, p253, doi 10.2307/1266042; bartlett ms, 1935, j royal stat soc s, v2, p224; bingham d, 1999, technometrics, v41, p62, doi 10.2307/1270995; bingham dr, 2001, j qual technol, v33, p2; bisgaard s, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p39; bisgaard s, 1998, qual eng, v10, p771; box g. e., 1987, empirical model buil; box g. e. p., 1978, stat expt; box gep, 1975, biometrika, v62, p347, doi 10.1093/biomet/62.2.347; box gep, 1992, j applied statistics, v19, p3; chen jh, 1993, int stat rev, v61, p131, doi 10.2307/1403599; daniel c., 1976, appl stat ind expt; daniel c, 1956, p 3 berk s math stat, v5; franklin mf, 1977, applied statistics, v26, p321; fries a, 1980, technometrics, v22, p601, doi 10.2307/1268198; goos p, 2001, j qual technol, v33, p436; goos p, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p12; huang p, 1998, technometrics, v40, p314, doi 10.2307/1270532; kempthorne o., 1952, design anal expt; kowalski sm, 2002, j qual technol, v34, p399; *sas i inc, 1999, sas qc us guid; trinca la, 2001, technometrics, v43, p25, doi 10.1198/00401700152404291; wu c.f.j, 2000, expt planning anal p; wu h, 2002, ann stat, v30; yates f, 1935, j roy stat soc     s, v2, p181, doi doi 10.2307/2983638","25","15","15","0","1","amer soc quality control-asqc","2006","56","64","9","kulahci, m; ramirez, jg; tobias, r","1.07","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","4","4","1","1","1","0","0","1","0","2","0","0"

"350","fraction of design space plots for examining model robustness","article","alphabetical optimality criteria; fds plot; mixture experiments; model reduction; response surface designs; scaled prediction variance","when choosing between competing designs, it is typical to specify a design space and model on which to base the comparison. the prediction capabilities of the design, specifically g- and v-efficiency using scaled prediction variance (spv), are based on this chosen model. after the data are collected and individual effects are tested, some terms may not be significant in the model. in this case, the experimenter likely will decide to use a reduced model, which has only a portion of the terms included that were in the original model for which the design was chosen. this paper presents a graphical method for examining design robustness related to the spv values using fraction of design space (fds) plots by comparing designs across a number of potential models in a prespecified model space. the fds plots show the various distributions of the spv throughout the design space for different models for a chosen design on the same graph. the methods are demonstrated on several examples for different models and on a variety of design spaces.","wyeth vaccines res, pearl river, ny 10965 usa; los alamos natl nat, stat sci grp, los alamos, nm 87545 usa; arizona state univ, tempe, az 85287 usa","ozol-godfrey, a (reprint author), wyeth vaccines res, pearl river, ny 10965 usa.","andrearendon j, 1997, j qual technol, v29, p451; andrews df, 1971, biometrika, v58, p427, doi 10.2307/2334379; atkinson ac, 1975, biometrika, v62, p57, doi 10.1093/biomet/62.1.57; bingham dr, 2002, j qual technol, v34, p244; borkowski jj, 2001, technometrics, v43, p468, doi 10.1198/00401700152672564; box g. e., 1987, empirical model buil; box gep, 1951, j roy stat soc b, v13, p1; box gep, 1967, technometrics, v9, p57, doi 10.2307/1266318; box mj, 1974, technometrics, v16, p613, doi 10.2307/1267614; cheng sw, 2001, stat sinica, v11, p553; chipman h, 1996, can j stat, v24, p17, doi 10.2307/3315687; cook rd, 1982, technometrics, v24, p49, doi 10.2307/1267577; cornell j. a., 2002, expt mixtures design; cornell ja, 1986, j qual technol, v18, p1; cox dr, 1961, p 4 berk s math stat, p105; draper nr, 1985, technometrics, v27, p173, doi 10.2307/1268765; dumouchel w, 1994, technometrics, v36, p37, doi 10.2307/1269197; giovannittijensen a, 1989, technometrics, v31, p159, doi 10.2307/1268814; goldfarb hb, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p169; goldschlager a, 2001, mcgill euro studies, v4, p109; hartley h. o., 1959, biometrics, v15, p611, doi 10.2307/2527658; heredia-langner a, 2004, j qual technol, v36, p263; hill pdh, 1978, technometrics, v20, p15, doi 10.2307/1268155; hoke at, 1974, technometrics, v16, p375, doi 10.2307/1267667; hunter wg, 1965, technometrics, v7, p307, doi 10.2307/1266591; khuri ai, 1996, comput stat data an, v22, p395, doi 10.1016/0167-9473(95)00058-5; li c, 2000, technometrics, v42, p345; montgomery dc., 2001, design anal expt; montogomery d. c., 2002, response surface met; notz w, 1982, j stat plan infer, v6, p47, doi 10.1016/0378-3758(82)90055-6; plackett rl, 1946, biometrika, v33, p305, doi 10.2307/2332195; roth pm, 1965, thesis princeton u; scheffe h, 1958, j roy stat soc b, v20, p344; vining gg, 1991, technometrics, v33, p315, doi 10.2307/1268783; wu cf, 1981, ann stat, v9, p1168, doi 10.1214/aos/1176345634; zahran a, 2003, j qual technol, v35, p377","36","12","12","0","3","taylor & francis inc","2005","223","235","13","ozol-godfrey, a; anderson-cook, cm; montgomery, dc","0.8","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","3","2","0","2","1","0","2","0","0","2","0"

"371","mixture component-amount designs via projections, including orthogonally blocked designs","article",NA,"traditional mixture experiments are designed to investigate the effects of changing the relative proportions of mixture ingredients using the same total amount, usually coded to 1, or to 100%. in some studies however, such as those on fertilizers, the total amount used also affects the response and needs to be investigated as well. for such component-amount experiments, several levels of total amount are needed. two ways of obtaining suitable designs are given here. both ways use the idea of projecting known mixture designs into fewer dimensions. first, standard designs of the simplex-lattice and simplex-centroid types are projected to obtain sets of points at various levels of total amount for two or more ingredients. the sets occur with varying multiplicities, which can be varied to produce d-optimal choices, if desired. second, orthogonally blocked (for standard second order mixtures models) designs that have previously been constructed by combining latin squares are projected down into lower dimensions. these projected designs are also orthogonal to specific component-amount models suggested in the literature for fitting data from component-amount designs, with proper choice of blocking variables. moreover, the specific designs of this type that are d-optimal in four dimensions for a second-order scheffe model remain d-optimal for the corresponding second-order component-amount model after projection into three dimensions. a previously published bread-making experiment that employed an orthogonally blocked design for four mixture ingredients provides data that are re-analyzed. we show a component-amount equation that performs well can be fitted in only two components, while the orthogonal blocking feature for the original design and mixture model is preserved for the projected design and the mixture-amount model.","univ southampton, southampton so17 1bj, hants, england; univ wisconsin, madison, wi 53706 usa","prescott, p (reprint author), univ southampton, southampton so17 1bj, hants, england.","chan ly, 1999, j appl stat, v26, p19, doi 10.1080/02664769922629; chan ly, 2000, commun stat-theor m, v29, p2281, doi 10.1080/03610920008832607; cornell j. a., 2002, expt mixtures design; czitrom v, 1988, commun stat theory, v17, p105, doi 10.1080/03610928808829613; czitrom v, 1989, commun stat theory, v18, p4561, doi 10.1080/03610928908830175; draper nr, 1993, technometrics, v35, p268, doi 10.2307/1269519; draper nr, 1993, technometrics, v36, p234; hilgers rd, 1995, j stat plan infer, v48, p241, doi 10.1016/0378-3758(95)00003-r; hilgers rd, 1999, biometrical j, v41, p783, doi 10.1002/(sici)1521-4036(199911)41:7<783::aid-bimj783>3.0.co;2-4; john p. w. m., 1984, 8 u tex aust ctr sta; lewis sm, 1994, j roy stat soc b met, v56, p457; nigam a. k., 1976, ann stat, v47, p1294; piepel gf, 1985, technometrics, v27, p219, doi 10.2307/1269703; piepel gf, 1988, technometrics, v30, p449; prescott p, 1993, j appl stat, v20, p105, doi 10.1080/02664769300000008; snee rd, 1995, technometrics, v37, p131, doi 10.2307/1269187","16","7","7","0","1","amer soc quality control-asqc","2004","413","431","19","prescott, p; draper, nr","0.44","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","2","0","0","0","1","0","3","0","0","0","0","0"
"372","a genetic algorithm approach to multiple-response optimization","article","heuristic methods; regression modeling; response surface desirability functions","many designed experiments require the simultaneous optimization of multiple responses. a common approach is to use a desirability function combined with an optimization algorithm to find the most desirable settings of the controllable factors. however, as the problem grows even moderately in either the number of factors or the number of responses, conventional optimization algorithms can fail to find the global optimum. an alternative approach is to use a heuristic search procedure such as a genetic algorithm (ga). this paper proposes and develops a multiple-response solution technique using a ga in conjunction with an unconstrained desirability function. the ga requires that several parameters be determined in order for the algorithm to operate effectively. we perform a robust designed experiment in order to tune the genetic algorithm to perform well regardless of the complexity of the multiple-response optimization problem. the performance of the proposed ga method is evaluated and compared with the performance of the method that combines the desirability with the generalized reduced gradient (grg) optimization. the evaluation shows that only the proposed ga approach consistently and effectively solves multiple-response problems of varying complexity.","florida a&m univ, dept ind engn, tallahassee, fl 32310 usa; florida state univ, dept ind engn, tallahassee, fl 32310 usa; pacific nw natl lab, richland, wa 99352 usa","ortiz, f (reprint author), florida a&m univ, dept ind engn, tallahassee, fl 32310 usa.","back t., 1996, evolutionary algorit; borkowski j.j., 2003, j probability stat s, v1, p65; carlyle wm, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p1; decastillo e, 1993, j qual technol, v25, p199; delcastillo e, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p337; derringer g, 1980, j qual technol, v12, p214; gill p. e., 1981, practical optimizati; goldberg d., 1989, genetic algorithm se; harrington j, 1965, ind quality control, v21, doi 10.1002/cmdc.200700139; heredia-langner a, 2003, j qual technol, v35, p28; heredialanger a, 2001, thesis arizona state; holland jh, 1974, adaptation natural a; khuri ai, 1981, technometrics, v23, p363, doi 10.2307/1268226; kros jf, 2001, qual reliab eng int, v17, p323, doi 10.1002/qre.404; mayer dg, 2001, agr syst, v69, p199, doi 10.1016/s0308-521x(01)00025-7; montgomery dc, 1999, j qual technol, v31, p45; montogomery d. c., 2002, response surface met; nelder ja, 1965, comput j, v7, p308, doi 10.1093/comjnl/7.4.308; pignatiello jj, 1993, iie trans, v25, p5, doi 10.1080/07408179308964286; reed p, 2000, water resour res, v36, p3757, doi 10.1029/2000wr900231; reklaitis gv, 1983, eng optimization met; schwefel hp, 1997, 31 ann m int soc gen, v2, p1025; vining gg, 1998, j qual technol, v30, p309; wehrens r, 1999, anal chim acta, p265","24","56","60","1","5","taylor & francis inc","2004","432","450","19","ortiz, f; simpson, jr; pignatiello, jj; heredia-langner, a","3.5","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","6","1","6","7","6","11","2","1","3","6","2","3","2"

"382","two approaches for improving the dual response method in robust parameter design","article","noise factors; process optimization; response surface methodology","the prediction properties of models used in the dual response approach to robust parameter design are studied, and two procedures that improve the performance of the approach are proposed. the first procedure suggests scaling of the noise variables to reduce the expected mean squared error of the variance model, based on the concept that the range of the noise variables used in the experimental design should contain most of their distribution. naturally, the scaling improves the fit of the part of the model associated with the noise factors. however, it is shown that such scaling does not alter the variance contribution of the noise factors, which is fundamental for robust parameter design. the second procedure combines the variance due to the noise factors with the variance due to the prediction error of the fitted model (i.e., it looks at the variance of the predictions), thus considering all sources of variability present in the problem. an unbiased estimator of this combined variance is developed. two examples are given for each procedure. the second proposed approach is compared with the dual response approach recommended in the literature by means of the prediction intervals of the responses, as recently discussed by myers et al. (1997). it is found in the examples that the new procedure gives narrower intervals (50%, and 12% percent smaller) where the degree of improvement depends, as expected, on the goodness of fit of the response surface model. the resulting solutions thus obtained are robust to both noise factor and parameter estimation uncertainty. negative variance values, possible in the usual dual response approach in the literature, are avoided in the new formulation.","eli lilly & co, eli lilly bioproc res & dev, lilly tech ctr n, indianapolis, in 46221 usa; penn state univ, dept ind & mfg engn, university pk, pa 16802 usa","miro-quesada, g (reprint author), eli lilly & co, eli lilly bioproc res & dev, lilly tech ctr n, indianapolis, in 46221 usa.","arnold s, 1981, theory linear models; arnold s., 1990, math stat; borkowski jj, 1997, technometrics, v39, p63, doi 10.2307/1270773; borror cm, 2000, qual reliab eng int, v16, p117, doi 10.1002/(sici)1099-1638(200003/04)16:2<117::aid-qre309>3.0.co;2-0; borror cm, 2002, j qual technol, v34, p54; box gep, 1990, report series qualit, v56; cantell b, 1997, stat case studies in; engel j, 1996, technometrics, v38, p365; giovannittijensen a, 1989, technometrics, v31, p159, doi 10.2307/1268814; khattre r, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p187; lucas jm, 1994, j qual technol, v26, p248; montogomery d. c., 2002, response surface met; myers rh, 1992, am stat, v46, p131, doi 10.2307/2684183; myers rh, 1992, j qual technol, v24, p1; myers rh, 1991, commun stat theory, v20, p457, doi 10.1080/03610929108830509; myers rh, 1997, j qual technol, v29, p429; neff ar, 1999, stat process monitor, p457; neter j., 1996, appl linear stat mod; shoemaker ac, 1991, technometrics, v33, p415, doi 10.2307/1269414; taguchi g., 1987, system expt design e; taguchi  genichi, 1986, intro quality eng; vining gg, 1993, j qual technol, v25, p45; vining gg, 1990, j qual technol, v22, p38","23","22","22","1","5","taylor & francis inc","2004","154","168","15","miro-quesada, g; del castillo, e","1.38","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","3","3","5","3","3","1","1","0","0","1","1","0","0"

"388","factorial experiments when factor levels are not necessarily reset","article","design of experiments; prediction variance; randomization; split-plot designs","in industry, the run order of experiments is often randomized, but this does not guarantee that all factor levels are reset from one run to the next. when this happens and the levels of factors are the same in successive runs, the assumption of independent observations from run to run may be violated or incorrect. in this case, an ordinary least squares analysis can produce biased estimates of the coefficients in the model, which leads to erroneous test results and inferences. in this paper we describe how not resetting the levels of one or more factors in successive runs can result in less precision in parameter estimates and a larger than expected prediction variance. we present formulas for the prediction variance and the expected prediction variance for this situation. these quantities are important because they allow us to compare the prediction properties of experiments that are completely randomized to experiments where the levels of one or more factors are not reset. we give an analysis of an industrial experiment of this type and recommendations for carrying out factorial experiments where the levels of one or more factors are not reset.","bemidji state univ, dept math & comp sci, bemidji, mn 56601 usa; jm lucas & associates, wilmington, de 19808 usa; montana state univ, dept math sci, bozeman, mt 59717 usa","webb, df (reprint author), bemidji state univ, dept math & comp sci, bemidji, mn 56601 usa.","anbari ft, 1993, thesis drexel u; atkinson a. c., 1992, optimum expt designs; bingham dr, 2001, j qual technol, v33, p1; ganju j, 1997, commun stat-theor m, v26, p47, doi 10.1080/03610929708831901; ganju j, 2000, am stat, v54, p5, doi 10.2307/2685603; ganju j, 1999, j stat plan infer, v81, p129, doi 10.1016/s0378-3758(99)00002-6; goos p, 2001, j qual technol, v33, p436; ju hl, 2002, j qual technol, v34, p411; kiefer j, 1974, ann math stat, v2; kiefer j., 1960, can j math, v12, p234, doi [doi 10.4153/cjm-1960-030-4, 10.4153/cjm-1960-030-4]; littell rc, 1996, sas system mixed mod; lucas jm, 1999, asq ann qual c t, p29; mood am, 1940, ann math stat, v11, p367, doi 10.1214/aoms/1177731825; *sas i, 1997, sas stat softw chang; searle sr, 1992, variance components; searle sr, 1982, matrix algebra usefu; trinca la, 2001, technometrics, v43, p25, doi 10.1198/00401700152404291; webb df, 1999, thesis montana state","18","28","28","0","2","taylor & francis inc","2004","1","11","11","webb, df; lucas, jm; borkowski, jj","1.75","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","3","2","2","8","2","2","2","1","1","1","0","0","2","0"

"393","establishing multivariate specification regions for incoming materials","article","multivariate analysis; partial least squares; quality control","we present a methodology for establishing meaningful multivariate specification regions on incoming materials or components. the approach uses multivariate pls regression models to extract information from databases and to relate the properties of incoming materials, and the process variables, to the quality measures on the customer's product. the specification regions are multivariate in nature and are defined in the latent variable space of the pls model. however, they are easy to implement in practice, and they can provide much insight into what constitutes acceptable material. the approach is illustrated using a simulated process, and is then used to establish multivariate specification regions for polymer resin properties in an industrial film process.","univ laval, dept chem engn, quebec city, pq g1k 7p4, canada; mcmaster univ, dept chem engn, hamilton, on l8s 4l7, canada; mcmaster univ, mcmaster adv control consortium, hamilton, on l8s 4l7, canada","duchesne, c (reprint author), univ laval, dept chem engn, quebec city, pq g1k 7p4, canada.","anderson tw, 1984, intro multivariate s; *aut div asqc, 1991, fund stat proc contr; brinkley s, 1991, asqc qual c t milw w, p497; burnham aj, 1996, j chemometr, v10, p31, doi 10.1002/(sici)1099-128x(199601)10:1<31::aid-cem398>3.0.co;2-1; burnham aj, 1999, chemometr intell lab, v48, p167, doi 10.1016/s0169-7439(99)00018-0; derringer g, 1980, j qual technol, v12, p214; desmet ja, 1993, thesis mcmaster u ha; duchesne c, 2000, thesis mcmaster u ha; eriksson l, 2001, multi megavariate da; fathi y, 1990, j qual technol, v22, p138; geladi p, 1986, anal chim acta, v185, p1, doi 10.1016/0003-2670(86)80028-9; harrington j, 1965, ind quality control, v21, doi 10.1002/cmdc.200700139; jackson je, 1979, technometrics, v21, p341, doi 10.2307/1267757; jaeckle cm, 1998, aiche j, v44, p1105, doi 10.1002/aic.690440509; jaeckle cm, 2000, chemometr intell lab, v50, p199, doi 10.1016/s0169-7439(99)00058-1; kourti t, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p409; kresta jv, 1991, can j chem eng, v69, p35, doi 10.1002/cjce.5450690105; macgregor jf, 1994, aiche j, v40, p826, doi 10.1002/aic.690400509; macgregor jf, 1997, int stat rev, v65, p309, doi 10.2307/1403374; martens h., 2001, multivariate anal qu; martens h, 1989, multivariate calibra; miller p., 1998, applied mathematics and computer science, v8, p775; nelson prc, 1996, chemometr intell lab, v35, p45, doi 10.1016/s0169-7439(96)00007-x; nomikos p, 1995, technometrics, v37, p41, doi 10.2307/1269152; *pol inc, 1996, b filmc 1 0; redlich ha, 1996, am ceram soc bull, v75, p71; ryan tp, 2000, stat methods quality; sidiropoulos v, 1995, thesis u mcmaster ha; stahle l, 1987, journal of chemometrics, v1, p185, doi 10.1002/cem.1180010306; taguchi  genichi, 1986, intro quality eng; *um inc, 1998, simca p 70; wade mr, 1993, j qual technol, v25, p161; wold h, 1984, ency stat sci, v6; wold h., 1975, perspectives probabi; wold s, 1978, technometrics, v20, p397, doi 10.2307/1267639; wold s, 1986, anal chim acta, v191, p17, doi 10.1016/s0003-2670(00)86294-7; yacoub f, 2003, chemometr intell lab, v65, p17, doi 10.1016/s0169-7439(02)00088-6; yarborough mj, 1995, am ceram soc bull, v74, p49; yarborough mj, 1995, ceramic eng sci p, v16, p298; zhang g, 1984, am soc quality contr, p175","40","21","21","0","3","amer soc quality control-asqc","2004","78","94","17","duchesne, c; macgregor, jf","1.31","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","2","1","1","3","2","4","3","1","3","0"

"398","the changepoint model for statistical process control","article","cumulative sum control charts; exponentially weighted moving average control charts; shewhart control charts","statistical process control (spc) requires statistical methodologies that detect changes in the pattern of data over time. the common methodologies, such as shewhart, cumulative sum (cusum), and exponentially weighted moving average (ewma) charting, require the in-control values of the process parameters, but these are rarely known accurately. using estimated parameters, the run length behavior changes randomly from one realization to another, making it impossible to control the run length behavior of any particular chart. a suitable methodology for detecting and diagnosing step changes based on imperfect process knowledge is the unknown-parameter changepoint formulation. long recognized as a phase i analysis tool, we argue that it is also highly effective in allowing the user to progress seamlessly from the start of phase i data gathering through phase ii spc monitoring. despite not requiring specification of the post-change process parameter values, its performance is never far short of that of the optimal cusum chart which requires this knowledge, and it is far superior for shifts away from the cusum shift for which the cusum chart is optimal. as another benefit, while changepoint methods are designed for step changes that persist, they are also competitive with the shewhart chart, the chart of choice for isolated non-sustained special causes.","univ minnesota, sch stat, minneapolis, mn 55455 usa; hanyang univ, dept ind engn, seoul 133791, south korea","hawkins, dm (reprint author), univ minnesota, sch stat, minneapolis, mn 55455 usa.","crowder sv, 1997, j qual technol, v29, p134; gombay e, 2000, stat probabil lett, v49, p195, doi 10.1016/s0167-7152(00)00048-1; hawkins d.m., 1998, cumulative sum chart; hawkins dm, 1987, j roy stat soc d-sta, v36, p299, doi 10.2307/2348827; hawkins dm, 1977, j am stat assoc, v72, p180, doi 10.2307/2286934; hinkley dv, 1971, biometrika, v58, p509, doi 10.1093/biomet/58.3.509; hinkley dv, 1970, biometrika, v57, p1; irvine jm, 1982, thesis yale u; jones la, 2001, technometrics, v43, p156, doi 10.1198/004017001750386279; lai tl, 2001, stat sinica, v11, p303; margavio tm, 1995, stat probabil lett, v24, p219, doi 10.1016/0167-7152(94)00174-7; nedumaran g, 2001, j qual technol, v33, p206; pignatiello jj, 2001, j qual technol, v33, p82; quesenberry cp, 1993, j qual technol, v25, p237; sen a, 1975, ann i stat math, v27, p479, doi 10.1007/bf02504665; sullivan jh, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p265; willsky as, 1976, ieee t automat contr, v21, p108, doi 10.1109/tac.1976.1101146; worsley kj, 1979, j am stat assoc, v74, p365, doi 10.2307/2286336; worsley kj, 1982, biometrika, v69, p297, doi 10.1093/biomet/69.2.297","19","173","179","3","18","amer soc quality control-asqc","2003","355","366","12","hawkins, dm; qiu, ph; kang, cw","10.18","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","4","5","6","5","11","14","9","9","19","14","13","21","23","19","1"

"411","separating location and dispersion effects in unreplicated fractional factorial designs","article","confounding; dispersion; fractional; factorial designs; variance","fractional factorial designs are often used in industry to screen potentially important factors in terms of their impact on the mean response, that is, their location effect. to save resources, these experiments are often unreplicated, in that only one observation is made at each design point. in addition to studying location effects, these designs may also be used to study dispersion effects. one of the difficulties in studying dispersion in these unreplicated designs is that dispersion effects are confounded with pairs of location effects. in this paper, we investigate the situation where a single dispersion effect is identified. we develop a procedure to determine the minimum number of additional runs needed to totally remove the confounding between this dispersion effect and two location effects. for situations where replication is not feasible, we develop a test for a pair of unidentified location effects conditioned on a single dispersion effect being detected. an example from the literature is used to demonstrate these two procedures.","bowling green state univ, dept appl stat & operat res, bowling green, oh 43403 usa","mcgrath, rn (reprint author), bowling green state univ, dept appl stat & operat res, bowling green, oh 43403 usa.","bergman b, 1997, technometrics, v39, p191, doi 10.2307/1270907; box g. e. p., 1978, stat expt; box gep, 1986, technometrics, v28, p19, doi 10.2307/1269600; cook rd, 1983, biometrika, v70, p1, doi 10.1093/biomet/70.1.1; daniel c, 1959, technometrics, v1, p311, doi doi 10.1080/00401706.1959.10489866; daniel c, 1978, appl stat ind expt; davidian m, 1987, j am stat assoc, v82, p1079, doi 10.2307/2289384; hamada m, 1998, stat sinica, v8, p1; johnson n. l., 1994, continuous univariat, v1; lenth rv, 1989, technometrics, v31, p469, doi 10.2307/1269997; mcgrath rn, 2002, j nonparametr stat, v14, p699, doi 10.1080/1048525021000008518; mcgrath rn, 2001, technometrics, v43, p406, doi 10.1198/00401700152672492; mcgrath rn, 2001, j qual technol, v33, p129; montgomery dc., 2001, design anal expt; montgomery dc, 1990, quality eng, v3, p193; nair vn, 1988, technometrics, v30, p247, doi 10.2307/1270079; pan gh, 1999, technometrics, v41, p313, doi 10.2307/1271348; wolfinger rd, 1998, technometrics, v40, p62, doi 10.2307/1271393","18","5","5","0","0","amer soc quality control-asqc","2003","306","316","11","mcgrath, rn","0.29","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","1","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","0"
"412","on the monitoring of linear profiles","article","calibration; exponentially weighted; moving average control chart; multivariate t-2 control charts; statistical process control","we propose control chart methods for process monitoring when the quality of a process or product is characterized by a linear function. in the historical analysis of phase i data, we recommend methods including the use of a bivariate t-2 chart to check for stability of the regression coefficients in conjunction with a univariate shewhart chart to check for stability of the variation about the regression line. we recommend the use of three univariate control charts in phase ii. these three charts are used to monitor the y-intercept, the slope, and the variance of the deviations about the regression line, respectively. a simulation study shows that this type of phase ii method can detect sustained shifts in the parameters better than competing methods in terms of average run length performance. we also relate the monitoring of linear profiles to the control charting of regression-adjusted variables and other methods.","virginia tech, dept stat, blacksburg, va 24061 usa","kim, k (reprint author), virginia tech, dept stat, blacksburg, va 24061 usa.","acosta-mejia ca, 1999, iie trans, v31, p569; albin sl, 2002, communication; andrews dwk, 1996, j econometrics, v70, p9, doi 10.1016/0304-4076(94)01682-8; brill r. v., 2001, 45 ann fall techn c; crowder sv, 1992, j qual technol, v24, p12; hauck dj, 1999, commun stat-simul c, v28, p309, doi 10.1080/03610919908813551; hawkins dm, 1991, technometrics, v33, p61, doi 10.2307/1269008; hawkins dm, 1993, j qual technol, v25, p170; jensen dr, 1984, manage sci, v30, p1197, doi 10.1287/mnsc.30.10.1197; jin jh, 2001, j intell manuf, v12, p257, doi 10.1023/a:1011248925750; jones mc, 1992, am stat, v46, p140, doi 10.2307/2684184; kang l, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p418; lawless jf, 1999, j qual technol, v31, p131; lawless jf, 1980, stat models methods; lowry ca, 1992, technometrics, v34, p46, doi 10.2307/1269551; lowry ca, 1995, commun stat simulat, v24, p409, doi 10.1080/03610919508813250; lucas jm, 1990, technometrics, v32, p1, doi 10.2307/1269835; mandel bj, 1969, j qual technol, v1, p1; mestek o, 1994, fresen j anal chem, v350, p344, doi 10.1007/bf00325603; miller a, 2002, j qual technol, v34, p139; montgomery d.c., 2001, intro stat quality c; myers r., 1990, classical modern reg; nair vn, 2002, j qual technol, v34, p355; ryan t.p., 1997, modern regression me; ryan tp, 2000, stat methods quality; steiner sh, 1999, j qual technol, v31, p75; stover fs, 1998, j chromatogr a, v804, p37, doi 10.1016/s0021-9673(98)00094-6; wade mr, 1993, j qual technol, v25, p161; walker e, 2002, j qual technol, v34, p118; zhang gx, 1992, cause selecting cont","30","234","237","0","9","amer soc quality control-asqc","2003","317","328","12","kim, k; mahmoud, ma; woodall, wh","13.76","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","2","3","11","10","15","13","18","19","15","21","27","26","25","22","5"

"417","semiparametric exact optimal run orders","article","design of experiments; optimal design; simulated annealing; trends","when performing an experiment, the observed responses are often influenced by a temporal trend possibly due to aging of material, learning effects, equipment wear-out, or warm-up effects. the construction of run orders that are optimally balanced for time trend effects usually relies on the incorporation of a parametric representation of the time dependence. using a parametric approach works very well as long as the unknown time dependence is properly specified or overspecified. however, for complicated temporal trends of unknown periodicity, or when the design size is small compared to the complexity of the response model, a parametric approach may lead to underspecification of the true time trend. serious problems of bias can result. in this paper we show that, contrary to a fully parametric approach with an underfitted time trend, modeling the time trend non parametrically is very attractive in terms of both bias and precision of the parameter estimators. an algorithm is presented for the construction of optimal run orders when kernel smoothing is used to model the temporal trend. an industrial example illustrates the practical utility of the proposed design methodology.","katholieke univ leuven, b-3000 louvain, belgium","tack, l (reprint author), katholieke univ leuven, naamsestr 69, b-3000 louvain, belgium.","atkinson ac, 1996, technometrics, v38, p333, doi 10.2307/1271304; box mj, 1971, technometrics, v13, p731, doi 10.2307/1266950; bradley ra, 1980, ann stat, v8, p883, doi 10.1214/aos/1176345081; butler na, 1989, 983 u read; butler na, 1990, 992a u read; clark rm, 1977, j roy stat soc b met, v39, p107; craven p, 1979, numer math, v31, p377; draper nr, 1968, appl regression anal; epanechn.va, 1969, theor probab appl+, v14, p153, doi 10.1137/1114019; faraway j, 1990, 177 u mich; faraway j, 1989, 174 u mihcigan; gasser t, 1985, j roy stat soc b met, v47, p238; green p, 1985, j r stat soc b, v47, p299; hardle w., 1990, appl nonparametric r; muller hg, 1984, stat probabil lett, v2, p285, doi 10.1016/0167-7152(84)90066-x; rice j, 1984, commun stat-theor m, v13, p893; speckman p, 1988, j roy stat soc b met, v50, p413; tack l, 2002, j qual technol, v34, p422; tack l, 2001, j stat plan infer, v98, p293, doi 10.1016/s0378-3758(00)00299-8; tack l, 2002, unpub trends resista","20","2","2","0","1","amer soc quality control-asqc","2003","168","183","16","tack, l; vandebroek, m","0.12","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1"

"421","predicting processes when embedded events occur: dynamic time warping","article","forecasting techniques; time-series analysis","in a traditional time-series analysis one assumes a model for the system. this model has a specified form that is consistent over time. however, in most continuous processes changing tank levels, system upsets (events), and transient process behaviors impact the accuracy of forecasts based on these global models. system behavior is often more closely related to local (short-term) process conditions and events that are repeated at random over time. the global model can predict average behavior, but it often does not accurately predict the local behavior of such a system. the traditional purpose of dynamic time warping was to detect predetermined patterns in speech recognition (time-series data). the technique depends on the development of templates, which represent known patterns or behavior. in this paper we extend the dynamic time warping technique to forecast process measurements using recent process data to define a (dynamic) template. this new dynamic template, dynamic-time-warping approach is compared to traditional methods of predicting process measurements when behavior typical of a continuous process is present. the key properties of such processes are described. the dynamic time warping approach is shown to be an effective method of prediction under these process assumptions.","arizona state univ, tempe, az 85287 usa; weyerhaeuser co, tacoma, wa 98477 usa","nelson, bj (reprint author), arizona state univ, tempe, az 85287 usa.","berndt dj, 1996, adv knowledge discov, p229; box gep, 1994, time series anal; cho hw, 2003, j qual technol, v35, p59; forster c, 1990, j neurosci meth, v31, p109, doi 10.1016/0165-0270(90)90155-9; gollmer k, 1996, control eng pract, v4, p1287, doi 10.1016/0967-0661(96)00136-0; grant pm, 1991, elect communicat feb, p37; macdonald i.l., 1997, hidden markov other; montgomery d., 1990, forecasting time ser; nicklas j. m., 1985, computers in cardiology (cat. no.85ch2217-8), p237; rabiner lr, 1983, at&t tech j, v62, p1075, doi 10.1002/j.1538-7305.1983.tb03115.x; wang jy, 1982, comput cardiol, p363","11","2","2","0","0","amer soc quality control-asqc","2003","213","226","14","nelson, bj; runger, gc","0.12","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","0","0","0"

"427","a method for predicting future observations in the monitoring of a batch process","article","batch process; monitoring; principal component analysis","batch processes play an important role in the production of low-volume, high-value products such as polymers, pharmaceuticals, and biochemicals. multiway principal components analysis (mpca), one of the multivariate projection methods, has been widely used for monitoring batch processes. one major problem in the on-line application of mpca is that the input data matrix for mpca is not complete until the end of the batch operation, and thus the unmeasured portion of the matrix (called the ""future observations"") has to be predicted. in this paper we propose a new method for predicting the future observations of the batch that is currently being operated (called the ""new batch""). the proposed method, unlike the existing prediction methods, makes extensive use of the past batch trajectories. the past batch trajectory which is deemed the most similar to the new batch is selected from the batch library and used as the basis for predicting the unknown part of the new batch. a case study on an industrial pvc batch process has been conducted. the results show that the proposed method results in more accurate prediction and has the capability of detecting process abnormalities earlier than the existing methods.","pohang univ sci & technol, div mech & ind engn, pohang 790784, kyungbuk, south korea","cho, hw (reprint author), pohang univ sci & technol, div mech & ind engn, pohang 790784, kyungbuk, south korea.","albert s, 2001, trends biotechnol, v19, p53, doi 10.1016/s0167-7799(00)01528-6; dong d, 1996, aiche j, v42, p2199, doi 10.1002/aic.690420810; jackson je, 1980, users guide principa; kaspar mh, 1992, aiche j, v38, p1593, doi 10.1002/aic.690381010; kosanovich ka, 1996, ind eng chem res, v35, p138, doi 10.1021/ie9502594; kourti t, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p409; kresta j, 1991, can j chem eng, v68, p35; lennox b, 2000, comput chem eng, v24, p291, doi 10.1016/s0098-1354(00)00480-4; macgregor jf, 1994, aiche j, v40, p826, doi 10.1002/aic.690400509; montgomery d.c., 2001, intro stat quality c; morris r. a., 1997, quality engineering, v10, p389, doi 10.1080/08982119708919147; nomikos p, 1995, chemometr intell lab, v30, p97, doi 10.1016/0169-7439(95)00043-7; nomikos p, 1995, technometrics, v37, p41, doi 10.2307/1269152; wise bm, 1996, j process contr, v6, p329, doi 10.1016/0959-1524(96)00009-1; wold s., 1987, j chemometr, v1, p41, doi doi 10.1002/cem.1180010107","15","24","27","0","1","amer soc quality control-asqc","2003","59","69","11","cho, hw; kim, kj","1.41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","3","2","3","3","3","2","1","0","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","0"

"431","c-charts, x-charts, and the katz family of distributions","article","average run length; maximum likelihood; method of moments; poisson distribution; robustness; statistical process control","in statistical process control, the primary method used to monitor the number of nonconformities is the c-chart. the conventional c-chart is based on the assumption that the occurrence of nonconformities in samples is well modeled by a poisson distribution. when the poisson assumption is not met, the x-chart (individuals chart) is often used as an alternative charting scheme. in this article, we investigate the relative merits of the c-chart compared to the x-chart for the katz family covering equi-, under-, and over-dispersed distributions relative to the poisson distribution. the need to use an x-chart rather than a c-chart depends upon whether or not the ratio of the in-control variance to the in-control mean is close to unity. the x-chart, which incorporates the information on this ratio, can lead to significant improvements under certain circumstances. both 3-sigma c- and x-charts fail to provide reliable information on the status of the process with a small in-control process mean when a downward mean shift occurs. in these cases, charts based on probability limits are much more appropriate.","univ oregon, lundquist coll business, eugene, or 97403 usa","fang, y (reprint author), univ oregon, lundquist coll business, 1208 coll business, eugene, or 97403 usa.","albin sl, 1989, manage sci, v35, p1066, doi 10.1287/mnsc.35.9.1066; bhat un, 1990, iie trans, v22, p181, doi 10.1080/07408179008964171; fa haight, 1967, hdb poisson distribu; fang y, 2002, j stat planning infe, v110, p77; friedman dj, 1993, int stat rev, v61, p97, doi 10.2307/1403596; gurland j, 1983, ency stat sci; hawkins d.m., 1998, cumulative sum chart; heimann pa, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p451; jinkinson ra, 1981, j roy stat soc d-sta, v30, p239, doi 10.2307/2988060; johnson n. l., 1969, discrete distributio; johnson nl, 1992, discrete distributio; katz l, 1963, p int s discr distr; mccool ji, 1998, j qual technol, v30, p240; mosteller f, 1985, exploring data table; nelson ls, 1994, j qual technol, v26, p239; ord jk, 1967, j r stat soc ser a-g, v130, p232, doi 10.2307/2343403; ryan tp, 1997, j qual technol, v29, p86; ryan tp, 1989, stat methods quality; wadsworth h., 1986, modern methods quali; wheeler dj, 1995, adv topics stat proc; woodall wh, 1995, iie trans, v27, p757, doi 10.1080/07408179508936792; woodall wh, 1997, j qual technol, v29, p172; woodall wh, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p341","23","13","13","0","0","amer soc quality control-asqc","2003","104","114","11","fang, y","0.76","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","1","0","1","0","2","2","1","1","0","1","1","1","0","0"

"441","on the performance of geometric charts with estimated control limits","article","average run length; false alarm probability; sample size; statistical process control","the control chart based on the geometric distribution (geometric chart) has been shown to be competitive with p- or np-charts for monitoring the proportion nonconforming, especially for applications in high quality manufacturing environments. however, implementing a geometric chart is often based on the assumption that the in-control proportion nonconforming is known or accurately estimated. for a high quality process, an accurate parameter estimate may require a very large sample size that is seldom available, in this paper we investigate the sample size effect when the proportion nonconforming is estimated. an analytical approximation is derived to compute shift detection probabilities and run length distributions. it is found that the effect on the alarm probability can be significant even with sample sizes as large as 10,000. however, the average run length is only affected mildly unless the sample size is small and there is a large process improvement. in practice, the quantitative results of the paper can be used to determine the minimum number of items required for estimating the control limits of a geometric chart so that certain average run length requirements are met.","singapore management univ, sch econ & social studies, singapore 259756, singapore; natl univ singapore, dept ind & syst engn, singapore 117543, singapore; georgia inst technol, sch ind & syst engn, atlanta, ga 30332 usa","yang, zl (reprint author), singapore management univ, sch econ & social studies, singapore 259756, singapore.","benneyan jc, 1994, asqc 48th annual quality congress proceedings, p32; benneyan jc, 2001, in press hlth care m; braud lm, 2001, j food eng, v50, p121, doi 10.1016/s0260-8774(00)00234-x; chen gm, 1997, stat sinica, v7, p789; chen gm, 1998, can j stat, v26, p311, doi 10.2307/3315513; chung kl, 1974, course probability t; glushkovsky ea, 1994, qual reliab eng int, v10, p217, doi 10.1002/qre.4680100312; goh tn, 1994, total qual manage, v12, p241; hiller f. s., 1969, j qual technol, v1, p17; kaminsky fc, 1992, j qual technol, v24, p63; montgomery d.c., 2001, intro stat quality c; nelson js, 2000, laser surg med, v26, p2; nelson ls, 1984, j qual technol, v16, p237; proschan f, 1960, ind quality control, v17, p12; quesenberry cp, 1995, j qual technol, v27, p304; quesenberry cp, 1993, j qual technol, v25, p237; quesenberry cp, 1991, j qual technol, v23, p231; ross s., 1994, 1 course probability; woodall wh, 1999, j qual technol, v31, p376; woodall wh, 1997, j qual technol, v29, p172; wu z, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p32; wu z, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p75; wu z, 2001, j qual technol, v33, p104; xie m., 1992, quality and reliability engineering international, v8, p355, doi 10.1002/qre.4680080409; xie m, 1997, int j quality reliab, v14, p64, doi doi 10.1108/02656719710156789","25","66","67","0","4","amer soc quality control-asqc","2002","448","458","11","yang, zl; xie, m; kuralmani, v; tsui, kl","3.67","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","3","4","5","3","2","3","4","3","6","7","6","7","6","5","1","1"

"449","transfer function modeling of processes with dynamic inputs","article","autocorrelation; statistical process control; time series analysis","time series structures, which are common occurrences with data in many industrial processes, complicate a quality practitioner's efforts to accurately position control chart limits. arima modeling and a variety of control charting methods have been recommended for monitoring process data with a time series structure. estimates of arima model parameters may not be reliable, however, if assignable causes of variation are present in the process data used to fit the time series model. control limits may also be misplaced if the process inputs are dynamic and exhibiting a time series structure. our purpose in this paper is to explore the ability of a transfer function model to identify assignable causes of variation and to model dynamic relationships between process inputs and outputs. a transfer function model is developed to monitor biochemical oxygen demand output from a wastewater treatment process, a process with dynamic inputs. this model is used to identify periods of disturbance to the wastewater process and to capture the relationship between the variable nature of the input to the process and the resulting output. simulation results are included in this study to measure the sensitivity of transfer function models and to highlight conditions where transfer function modeling is critical.","e carolina univ, dept decis sci, greenville, nc 27858 usa; univ rhode isl, dept management sci & stat, kingston, ri 02881 usa","west, d (reprint author), e carolina univ, dept decis sci, greenville, nc 27858 usa.","alwan l. c., 2000, stat process anal; alwan lc, 1992, commun stat theory, v21, p1025, doi 10.1080/03610929208830829; alwan lc, 1995, j r stat soc c-appl, v44, p269, doi 10.2307/2986036; alwan lc, 1988, j bus econ stat, v6, p87, doi 10.2307/1391421; alwan lc, 1992, iie trans, v24, p66, doi 10.1080/07408179208964246; atienza oo, 1998, j qual technol, v30, p340; berthouex pm, 1978, j qual technol, v10, p139; box gep, 1975, j am stat assoc, v70, p70, doi 10.2307/2285379; box gep, 1994, time series anal; boyles ra, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p395; chang i, 1988, technometrics, v30, p193, doi 10.2307/1270165; chen c, 1993, j am stat assoc, v88, p284, doi 10.2307/2290724; chen c, 1993, j forecasting, v12, p13, doi 10.1002/for.3980120103; fox aj, 1972, j roy stat soc b, v34, p350; kim bw, 1994, ieee t semiconduct m, v7, p12, doi 10.1109/66.286829; kusters u, 1995, forum joint newlette, v8, p1; lu cw, 2001, j qual technol, v33, p316; montgomery d. c., 1976, forecasting time ser; montgomery dc, 1991, j qual technol, v23, p179; notohardjono bd, 1986, j eng ind-t asme, v108, p219, doi 10.1115/1.3187067; poch m, 1993, wastewater treatment; smith ae, 1993, int j adv manuf tech, v8, p252, doi 10.1007/bf01748635; weller br, 1994, int j forecasting, v10, p481; wen ch, 1998, eng appl artif intel, v11, p685, doi 10.1016/s0952-1976(98)00036-0; woodall wh, 2000, j qual technol, v32, p341; wright cm, 2001, j qual technol, v33, p365; xia q, 1994, pulp pap-canada, v95, p51","27","9","9","0","3","amer soc quality control-asqc","2002","315","326","12","west, d; dellana, s","0.5","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","2","1","2","0","1","0","0","0"

"479","confidence interval coverage for designed experiments analyzed with glms","article","design of experiments; generalized linear models; nonconstant variance; nonnormality","there are many industrial experiments where the response variable is nonnormal. traditionally, variance-stabilizing transformations are made on such a response in order to obtain properties needed to use ordinary least squares and analysis of variance. generalized linear models (glms) offer a powerful alternative to data transformation. specifically, the performance in response estimation and prediction for a glm is often superior to the model built using data transformations. the confidence interval constructed around the estimate of the mean for each experimental run provides the experimenter with critical information about model quality. in generalized linear models, confidence intervals are based on asymptotic theory. as such, they are regarded as statistically valid only for large samples. therefore, in order to use confidence intervals to compare models. it is essential to evaluate these asymptotic intervals in terms of coverage for sample sizes typically encountered in designed industrial experiments. this paper uses monte carte methods to investigate the coverage of confidence intervals for the glm for factorial experiments with 8, 16, and 32 runs.","arizona state univ, dept ind engn, tempe, az 85287 usa; virginia polytech inst & state univ, blacksburg, va 24061 usa","lewis, sl (reprint author), arizona state univ, dept ind engn, tempe, az 85287 usa.","hahn g., 1994, stat models eng; lewis sl, 2001, j qual technol, v33, p265; lewis sl, 1998, thesis arizoan state; mccullagh p, 1989, gen linear models; montgomery d. c., 1992, intro linear regress; myers hw, 1997, bucina hist bras soc, v2, p29; myers r., 1990, classical modern reg; nelder ja, 1972, j r stat soc ser a-g, v135, p370, doi 10.2307/2344614; *sas i inc, 1993, p243 sas","9","15","19","0","2","amer soc quality control-asqc","2001","279","292","14","lewis, sl; montgomery, dc; myers, rh","0.79","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","3","1","2","1","0","0","1","1","3","0","0","1","0","0","1","0","1","0"

"485","detecting over rejection in testing of integrated circuits","article","bernoulli distribution; binomial distribution; cumulative sum control charts; statistical process control","in parallel testing of integrated circuits (ic's), ic's which are conforming in terms of electrical functionality are sometimes incorrectly rejected. this is commonly known as over rejection. over rejection is due to faulty sockets or failed components of the test hardware system associated with the socket locations. in this paper we propose a two-stage procedure for monitoring socket locations causing an over rejection: in stage one, a binomial test of proportions is used to identify socket locations which are causing an over rejection; in stage two, a cumulative sum scheme is used to monitor the socket locations to detect possible failures of components of the test hardware system. detection of faulty sockets or failed components results in a reduction of rejected conforming ic's. a simple method is provided for the design of such a procedure. formulas are also provided which allow the performance of the scheme to be evaluated. an application of the procedure in parallel testing of ic's is performed. a follow up study is conducted to determine practical problems with the procedure and to find solutions.","infineon technol integrated circuits, melaka 75914, malaysia; natl univ singapore, dept stat & appl probabil, singapore 117543, singapore","gan, ff (reprint author), infineon technol integrated circuits, melaka 75914, malaysia.","brook d, 1972, biometrika, v59, p539; lucas jm, 1989, j qual technol, v21, p199; mood a. m., 1974, intro theory stat; moustakides gv, 1986, ann stat, v14, p1379, doi 10.1214/aos/1176350164; page es, 1955, biometrika, v42, p243, doi 10.2307/2333440; woodall w. h., 1983, communications stat, v2, p27; woodall wh, 1985, technometrics, v27, p285, doi 10.2307/1269710","7","0","0","0","2","amer soc quality control-asqc","2001","356","364","9","chang, tc; gan, ff","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"

"490","some properties of ewma feedback quality adjustment schemes for drifting disturbances","article","exponential weighted moving average; feedback control; process adjustment; process drift","control schemes that are simple enough for operators to implement and that are robust with respect to the underlying model assumptions are usually sought in the area of process adjustment. in the last few years, process adjustment schemes based on the exponentially-weighted-moving-average (ewma) statistic have gained popularity in the manufacturing of semiconductors. in the literature, the analysis of this type of adjustment technique has concentrated on a single ewma controller applied to a system that experiences a deterministic trend disturbance. although other types of drift models can provide a better description of the disturbance, the performance analysis of ewma controllers under such conditions has not been undertaken in the past. in this paper we present practical stability and robustness results for single and double ewma controllers under a variety of process disturbances acting on a ""responsive"" system. drift disturbances considered include a random walk with drift, ima(1,1), and an arma disturbance with drift. the effects of errors in the model gain estimate are studied for single ewma controllers applied to these disturbances. the optimal weight parameter of a single ewma controller is derived for the case of a random walk with drift disturbance. it is shown that the conditions required for obtaining a stable quality characteristic under the adjustments of the controller are invariant with respect to a large family of drift disturbances. a method is presented for choosing the weights in a double ewma controller under the assumption that the process gain is known.","penn state univ, dept ind & mfg engn, university pk, pa 16802 usa","del castillo, e (reprint author), penn state univ, dept ind & mfg engn, university pk, pa 16802 usa.","astrom k. j., 1997, computer controlled; box g, 1997, j qual technol, v29, p248; box g. p, 1997, stat control monitor; box gep, 1994, time series anal; box gep, 1995, statistician, v44, p479; butler sw, 1994, ieee t semiconduct m, v7, p193, doi 10.1109/66.286855; del castillo e, 1999, iie trans, v31, p1157; delcastillo e, 1997, j qual technol, v29, p184; delcastillo e, 2000, in press technometri; garcia ce, 1985, ind eng chem proc dd, v24, p472, doi 10.1021/i200029a043; hamby es, 1998, in press ieee t semi; hamilton j. d., 1994, time series anal; ingolfsson a, 1993, j qual technol, v25, p271; jensen kl, 1993, technometrics, v35, p376, doi 10.2307/1270271; luceno a, 1999, technometrics, v41, p142, doi 10.2307/1270730; macgregor jf, 1988, chem eng prog, v84, p21; patel ns, 1998, unpub adaptive optim; rivera de, 1986, ind eng chem proc dd, v25, p252, doi 10.1021/i200032a041; sachs e, 1995, ieee t semiconduct m, v8, p26, doi 10.1109/66.350755; smith e, 1997, environ toxicol phar, v4, p3, doi 10.1016/s1382-6689(97)10035-7; tsung f, 1998, technometrics, v40, p214, doi 10.2307/1271177; yusof r, 1993, int j control, v57, p1387, doi 10.1080/00207179308934453","22","30","30","2","2","amer soc quality control-asqc","2001","153","166","14","del castillo, e","1.58","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","4","3","4","2","1","2","0","3","2","2","0","0","2","0","0","3","2","0"

"501","small sample properties of an adaptive filter applied to low volume spc","article","adaptive filtering; autocorrelated observations","in many manufacturing environments. such as the nuclear weapons complex, emphasis has shifted from the regular production and delivery of large orders to infrequent small orders. however, the challenge to maintain the same high quality and reliability standards while building much smaller lot sizes remains. to meet this challenge, specific areas need more attention, including fast and on-target process start-up, low volume statistical process control, process characterization with small experiments, and estimating reliability given few actual performance tests of the product. in this paper we address the issue of low volume statistical process control. we investigate an adaptive filtering approach to process monitoring with a relatively short time series of autocorrelated data. the emphasis is on estimation and minimization of mean squared error rather than the traditional hypothesis testing and run length analyses associated with process control charting. we develop an adaptive filtering technique that assumes initial process parameters are unknown, and updates the parameters as more data become available. using simulation techniques, we study the data requirements (the length of a time series of autocorrelated data) necessary to adequately estimate process parameters. we show that far fewer data values are needed than is typically recommended for process control applications. we also demonstrate the techniques with a case study from the nuclear weapons manufacturing complex.","sandia natl labs, albuquerque, nm 87185 usa; cornell univ, ithaca, ny 14853 usa","crowder, sv (reprint author), sandia natl labs, pob 5800, albuquerque, nm 87185 usa.","astrom karl johan, 1970, intro stochastic con; box gep, 1994, time series anal; cooley t, 1971, thesis u pennsylvani; crowder s. v., 1986, thesis iowa state u; crowder sv, 1995, stat process control; duncan db, 1972, j am stat assoc, v67, p815, doi 10.2307/2284643; harrison pj, 1971, oper res quart, v22, p341, doi 10.2307/3008187; harrison pj, 1967, manage sci, v13, p821, doi doi 10.1287/mnsc.13.11.821; macgregor jf, 1973, can j chem eng, v51, p468, doi 10.1002/cjce.5450510412; meinhold rj, 1983, am stat, v37, p123, doi 10.2307/2685871; montgomery d. c., 1996, intro stat quality c; quesenberry cp, 1993, j qual technol, v25, p237; sarris ah, 1973, ann economic social, v2, p501; smith jq, 1979, j roy stat soc b met, v41, p375; vanderwiel sa, 1996, technometrics, v38, p139, doi 10.1080/00401706.1996.10484459; wardell dg, 1994, technometrics, v36, p3, doi 10.2307/1269191; wardell dg, 1992, manage sci, v38, p1084, doi 10.1287/mnsc.38.8.1084; woodall wh, 1995, j qual technol, v27, p328","18","14","16","0","1","amer soc quality control-asqc","2001","29","46","18","crowder, sv; eshleman, l","0.74","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","2","2","0","1","0","1","1","2","1","1","0","0","0","1","0"

"523","comparisons of exponential life test plans with intermittent inspections","article","censored data; grouped data; inspection; life testing; maximum likelihood estimator","most of the existing life test plans are concerned with life tests conducted under continuous inspection of test items. however, a reduction in testing effort and administrative convenience may be achieved by employing intermittent inspection in which items are inspected only at certain points in time. the well-known hybrid plan, which employs a single inspection at the censoring time, is frequently used in practice. to investigate whether or not adding more inspections to the hybrid plan improves its statistical performance substantially, a life test plan with multiple inspections is first developed assuming that the lifetimes of items follow an exponential distribution. for multiple inspection times, equally-spaced, equal-probability, and equally-spaced in log-time inspection schemes are considered. the developed plan is then compared to the hybrid and the type i-censored life test plan with continuous inspection in terms of the sample size required, the expected completion time to reach a decision, and the power of test. computational results indicate that the above performance measures are relatively insensitive to the inspection scheme employed, which implies that the equally-spaced inspection scheme may be considered as an appropriate choice since it is more convenient to schedule and does not require a priori information on unknown parameters. another important finding is that the life test plan with multiple inspections is preferred when the discrimination ratio is small and the censoring time is large. otherwise, conducting more than one inspection does not improve statistical performances substantially, and the hybrid plan is generally recommended.","agcy def dev, taejon 305600, south korea; korea adv inst sci & technol, dept ind engn, taejon 305701, south korea","kim, sh (reprint author), agcy def dev, taejon 305600, south korea.","epstein b, 1953, j am stat assoc, v48, p486, doi 10.2307/2281004; epstein b, 1954, ann math stat, v25, p555, doi 10.1214/aoms/1177728723; grant e. l., 1986, stat quality control; jeong hs, 1995, commun stat simulat, v24, p187, doi 10.1080/03610919508813237; juran j.m., 1988, quality control hdb; kendell pj, 1971, technometrics, v13, p289, doi 10.2307/1266791; klinger dj, 1990, at t reliability man; kulldorff g., 1961, contributions theory; lawless jf, 1982, stat models methods; meeker wq, 1986, ieee t reliab, v35, p571, doi 10.1109/tr.1986.4335550; nelson w, 1977, ieee t reliab, v26, p226, doi 10.1109/tr.1977.5220123; nelson w., 1982, appl life data anal; shapiro ss, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p429; spurrier jd, 1980, j am stat assoc, v75, p405, doi 10.2307/2287467","14","16","16","0","1","amer soc quality control-asqc","2000","217","230","14","kim, sh; yum, bj","0.8","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","3","1","2","1","2","0","2","0","2","1","1"

"551","optimal central composite designs in the presence of dispersion effects","article",NA,"the central composite design (ccd) is often used to provide estimation of a second-order regression model. the ccd involves a possibly fractionated two-level factorial design, axial points, and replicated runs in the design center and is usually used with the assumption of homogeneous variance in the design region. however, when dispersion effects exist, standard ccd's may not be optimal. with a specified number of experimental runs available, the goal is to find the optimal allocation of the runs to the ccd locations. in this paper, several variance structures are considered in conjunction with several scaled degrees of heterogeneity expressed in terms of variance ratios. optimality criteria based on the determinant of the variance-covariance matrix of coefficients (d-optimality) and on the integrated prediction variance (i-optimality) are used. two, three, and four variable models are considered, and in each heterogeneous variance structure case, the run allocations that creates the d- and i-optimal designs are presented.","virginia commonwealth univ, dept math sci, richmond, va 23284 usa","mays, dp (reprint author), virginia commonwealth univ, dept math sci, richmond, va 23284 usa.","aitkin m, 1987, appl stat-j roy st c, v36, p332; box gep, 1959, j am stat assoc, v54, p622; box gep, 1986, technometrics, v28, p19, doi 10.2307/1269600; box gep, 1951, j roy stat soc b, v13, p1; box gep, 1963, biometrika, v50, p335, doi 10.2307/2333904; cook rd, 1983, biometrika, v70, p1, doi 10.1093/biomet/70.1.1; davidian m, 1987, transformation weigh; kiefer j, 1959, ann math stat, v30, p271, doi 10.1214/aoms/1177706252; kiefer j, 1959, j roy stat soc b, v21, p272; mays dp, 1997, j qual technol, v29, p59; mccullagh p, 1987, ann stat, v15, p202, doi 10.1214/aos/1176350261; myers r. h., 1995, response surface met; nair vn, 1988, technometrics, v30, p247, doi 10.2307/1270079; pukelsheim f, 1993, optimal design expt; *sas i inc, 1985, sas iml us guid ver; taguchi g, 1988, sn ratio quality eva; taguchi g., 1977, expt design, v2; taguchi g, 1980, intro off line quali; taguchi g, 1977, expt design, v1; taguchi  genichi, 1986, intro quality eng; vining gg, 1996, j qual technol, v28, p135; yates f, 1937, design anal factoria","22","2","2","0","1","amer soc quality control-asqc","1999","398","407","10","mays, dp","0.1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0"

"574","detecting when a monotonically increasing mean has crossed a threshold","article","change point; cumulative sum; exponentially weighted moving average; generalized likelihood ratio; monte carlo simulation; regression analysis; statistical process control","for monitoring a sequence of random variables, the cumulative sum (cusum) sequential change-point detection scheme has optimality properties if the mean experiences a single, one-time jump increase from one known level to another. however, many monitoring situations are not realistically described by this stylized change-point model. for example, in modeling tool wear, gradual monotonic changes in the mean should be allowed. in this paper. we introduce a model that assumes only that the mean is nondecreasing over time and investigate how to let the process continue as long as its mean is under some specified threshold value, stopping it as soon as possible after the mean exceeds the threshold. we show how to apply the cusum and the exponentially weighted moving average (ewma) to this problem as well as compare these procedures to a repeated generalized likelihood ratio test (glr) designed specifically for the monotone setting. a simulation study demonstrates that the cusum and ewma, properly applied, perform surprisingly well compared to the glr test, usually outperforming it. we argue that the cusum is the best overall choice.","yale univ, dept stat, new haven, ct 06520 usa; rand corp, santa monica, ca 90407 usa","chang, jt (reprint author), yale univ, dept stat, new haven, ct 06520 usa.","adams bm, 1992, frontiers stat quali, v4; aers d, 1991, lit hist-third ser, v2, p20; basseville m, 1993, detection abrupt cha; bissell af, 1984, appl stat-j roy st c, v33, p145; crowder sv, 1997, j qual technol, v29, p134; crowder sv, 1992, j qual technol, v24, p12; crowder sv, 1987, technometrics, v29, p401, doi 10.2307/1269450; crowder sv, 1989, j qual technol, v21, p155; gan f, 1991, j stat comput sim, v38, p181; gan ff, 1993, j qual technol, v25, p205; gan ff, 1992, statistician, v41, p71, doi 10.2307/2348638; gold ms, 1989, biometrika, v76, p725; hunter js, 1986, j qual technol, v18, p203; lorden g, 1971, ann math stat, v42, p1897, doi 10.1214/aoms/1177693055; lucas jm, 1990, technometrics, v32, p1, doi 10.2307/1269835; manuele j, 1945, ind quality control, v1, p7; moustakides gv, 1986, ann stat, v14, p1379, doi 10.1214/aos/1176350164; narayanan sb, 1994, ieee p 1994 int c ac, v6, p137; page es, 1954, biometrika, v41, p100, doi 10.2307/2333009; quesenberry cp, 1988, j qual technol, v20, p220; ritov y, 1990, ann stat, v18, p1464, doi 10.1214/aos/1176347761; robert s. w., 1959, technometrics, v1, p239, doi doi 10.1080/00401706.1959.10489860; robertson t, 1988, order restricted sta; waldmann kh, 1986, technometrics, v28, p61, doi 10.2307/1269604; woodall w. h., 1993, qual eng, v5, p559; woodall wh, 1983, technometrics, v25, p295, doi 10.2307/1268615; yashchin e, 1993, int stat rev, v61, p41, doi 10.2307/1403593","27","15","16","1","4","amer soc quality control-asqc","1999","217","234","18","chang, jt; fricker, rd","0.71","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","2","0","0","0","2","0","1","1","3","1","0","2","1","0","0","0"

"579","statistics as a catalyst to learning by scientific method part ii - a discussion","article; proceedings paper","experimentation; investigation; response surface methodology; robustness","industrial success requires efficient experimentation both for the improvement of existing products and processes and for development of new ones. because results are usually known quickly, the natural way to experiment is to use information from each group of runs to plan the next. such investigation employs a scientific paradigm in which data drives an alternation of induction and deduction. this process can suggest at each stage how questions that are still at issue can be resolved. response surface methods are a group of statistical techniques specifically designed to catalyze scientific learning of this kind. in this paper, the scientific paradigm for discovery and sequential learning is contrasted with the mathematical paradigm for the proof of theorems. it is argued that, because statistical training unduly emphasizes mathematics at the expense of science, confusion between the two paradigms occurs. this has resulted in emphasis on the development and use of ""one-shot"" statistical procedures which mimic the mathematical paradigm-examples are hypothesis testing and the use of alphabetically optimal designs. such one-shot procedures, where the model is assumed known a priori and fixed, are appropriate for some practical problems and are attractive because they allow rigorous development of theories of statistics based on mathematics alone. by contrast, discovery of new knowledge requires the use of the scientific paradigm in which the model is continually changing. scientific method is thus mathematically incoherent. the importance of robustness is discussed both for analysis and design, and the relationship between these two kinds of robustness is clarified. implications for teaching are discussed.","univ wisconsin, ctr qual & prod improvement, madison, wi 53705 usa; univ wisconsin, dept stat, madison, wi 53705 usa; univ wisconsin, dept ind engn, madison, wi 53705 usa","box, gep (reprint author), univ wisconsin, ctr qual & prod improvement, madison, wi 53705 usa.","box g, 1997, qual prog, v30, p47; box g, 1996, biometrika, v83, p950, doi 10.1093/biomet/83.4.950; box g, 1960, technometrics, v2, p455, doi doi 10.1080/00401706.1960.10489912; box g., 1986, 8 u wisc ctr qual pr; box g. e., 1987, empirical model buil; box g. e., 1993, qual eng, v6, p503; box g.e.p., 1973, 9 u wisc dep stat; box g. e. p., 1992, total qual manage, v3, p265, doi doi 10.1080/09544129200000034; box g. e. p., 1993, quality eng, v5, p663; box gep, 1964, j roy stat soc b, v26, p211; box gep, 1962, technometrics, v4, p531, doi 10.2307/1266288; box gep, 1951, j roy stat soc b, v13, p1; box gep, 1961, technometrics, v3, p449, doi 10.2307/1266553; box gep, 1954, biometrika, v41, p190, doi 10.2307/2333016; box gep, 1980, j roy stat soc a sta, v143, p383, doi 10.2307/2982063; box gep, 1993, j qual technol, v25, p94; box gep, 1955, biometrics, v11, p287, doi 10.2307/3001769; box gep, 1980, bayesian stat; box gep, 1983, sci inference data; box gep, 1997, stat quality control; box gep, 1987, designing ind expt e; box gep, 1994, 116 u wisc ctr qual; box gep, 1954, j royal stat soc b, v16, p211; box gep, 1998, unpub technical repo; box gep, 1992, j applied statistics, v19, p3; daniel c, 1962, j am stat assoc, v57, p403, doi 10.2307/2281648; deming w. e., 1982, out crisis; deming w. e., 1950, some theory sampling; duncan ja, 1974, quality control ind; finney dj, 1945, ann eugenic, v12, p291; fisher ronald aylmer, 1935, design expt; hellstrand c, 1989, philos t r soc a, v327, p529, doi 10.1098/rsta.1989.0008; kim kj, 1998, j qual technol, v30, p1; lin dkj, 1993, technometrics, v35, p28, doi 10.2307/1269286; lin dkj, 1995, technometrics, v37, p213, doi 10.2307/1269622; lin dkj, 1993, technometrics, v35, p284; lin kj, 1992, technometrics, v4, p423; lucs jm, 1996, am stat ass p; meyer rd, 1996, technometrics, v38, p330; michaels se, 1964, appl stat, v13, p221; morrison s. j., 1957, applied statistics, v6, p133; plackett rl, 1946, biometrika, v33, p305, doi 10.2307/2332195; shewhart wa, 1939, stat method view poi; taguchi  genichi, 1986, intro quality eng; vining gg, 1990, j qual technol, v22, p38; yates f., 1937, 35 imp bur soil sci","46","49","50","2","6","amer soc quality control-asqc","1999","16","29","14","box, gep","2.33","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","3","2","2","2","1","2","2","7","1","5","2","1","6","6","2","1","1","1","0"

"582","a cusum chart for monitoring a proportion when inspecting continuously","article","attributes control charts; bernoulli cumulative sum; p charts; proportion; statistical process control","a control chart is considered for the problem of monitoring a process when all items from the process are inspected and classified into one of two categories. the objective is to detect changes in the proportion, p, of items in the first category. the control chart being considered is a cumulative sum (cusum) chart based on the bernoulli observations corresponding to the inspection of the individual items. bernoulli cusum charts can be constructed to detect increases in p, decreases in p, or both increases and decreases in p. the properties of the bernoulli cusum chart are evaluated using exact markov chain methods and by using a corrected diffusion theory approximation. the corrected diffusion theory approximation provides a relatively simple method of designing the chart for practical applications. it is shown that the bernoulli cusum chart will detect changes in p substantially faster than the traditional approach of grouping items into samples and applying a shewhart p-chart. the bernoulli cusum chart is also better than grouping items into samples and applying a cusum chart to the sample statistics. the bernoulli cusum chart is equivalent to a geometric cusum chart which is based on counting the number of items in the second category that occur between items in the first category.","virginia polytech inst & state univ, dept stat, blacksburg, va 24061 usa; virginia polytech inst & state univ, dept forestry, blacksburg, va 24061 usa; rutgers state univ, dept management sci & informat syst, newark, nj 07102 usa","reynolds, mr (reprint author), virginia polytech inst & state univ, dept stat, blacksburg, va 24061 usa.","bourke pd, 1991, j qual technol, v23, p225; brook d, 1972, biometrika, v59, p539; burden rl, 1993, numerical anal; cheney ward, 1985, numerical math compu; gan f. f., 1993, j appl stat, v20, p445; ghosh bk, 1970, sequential tests sta; hawkins d.m., 1998, cumulative sum chart; hawkins dm, 1992, commun stat simulat, v21, p1001, doi 10.1080/03610919208813063; lucas jm, 1982, technometrics, v24, p199, doi 10.2307/1268679; lucas jm, 1989, j qual technol, v21, p199; page es, 1954, biometrika, v41, p100, doi 10.2307/2333009; rendtel u., 1990, statistical papers, v31, p103; reynolds mr, 1990, technometrics, v32, p371, doi 10.2307/1270114; reynolds mr, 1996, iie trans, v28, p497, doi 10.1080/07408179608966297; reynolds mr, 1998, iie trans, v30, p545, doi 10.1080/07408179808966494; reynolds mr, 1998, in press stat proces; runger gc, 1995, j qual technol, v27, p283; ryan tp, 1997, j qual technol, v29, p86; siegmund d, 1979, adv appl probab, v11, p701, doi 10.2307/1426855; siegmund david, 1985, sequential anal; stoumbos zg, 1997, j qual technol, v29, p21; stoumbos zg, 1997, nonlinear anal-theor, v30, p3987, doi 10.1016/s0362-546x(97)00014-x; wald a., 1947, sequential anal; woodall w. h., 1993, qual eng, v5, p559; woodall wh, 1997, j qual technol, v29, p172; yashchin e, 1985, adv appl probab, v17, p562, doi 10.2307/1427120; zacks s, 1981, commun stat a-theor, v10, p2245, doi 10.1080/03610928108828185","27","109","109","0","12","amer soc quality control-asqc","1999","87","108","22","reynolds, mr; stoumbos, zg","5.19","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","6","1","2","4","2","5","5","8","10","5","6","6","12","11","9","4","7","4","0"

"589","a spc procedure for detecting level shifts of autocorrelated processes","article","average run length; control charts; outliers; statistical process control; time series analysis","recent advances in manufacturing automation make the collection of data for gauging process condition fast and economical. in most cases, the classical statistical process (spc) control procedures cannot be directly implemented due to the inherent autocorrelation in the data series. a common approach to monitoring autocorrelated processes is to apply the classical spc techniques on the residuals of a chosen autoregressive moving average model. however, the sensitivity of the residual-based spc procedures in detecting process shift deteriorates when the process is highly positively autocorrelated. in this paper, we propose the application of the statistics used for detecting outliers and level shifts in time series for process monitoring. focusing on level shift detection and using a first order autorregessive (ar(1)) model with the average run length as the criterion for comparing the performance of control charting procedures, we show that the proposed charting scheme has a superior performance in detecting level shifts. the proposed scheme can easily be extended to effectively detect the presence of additive and innovational outliers.","natl univ singapore, singapore 117548, singapore","atienza, oo (reprint author), natl univ singapore, singapore 117548, singapore.","alwan lc, 1992, commun stat theory, v21, p1025, doi 10.1080/03610929208830829; alwan lc, 1988, j bus econ stat, v6, p87, doi 10.2307/1391421; balke ns, 1993, j bus econ stat, v11, p81, doi 10.2307/1391308; box g. e, 1976, time series anal for; brockwell pj, 1987, time series theory m; chang i, 1988, technometrics, v30, p193, doi 10.2307/1270165; chen c, 1993, j am stat assoc, v88, p284, doi 10.2307/2290724; harrison r.g., 1990, oxford surveys in evolutionary biology, v7, p69; montgomery d. c, 1989, stat process control; montgomery dc, 1991, intro stat quality c; pankratz a., 1991, forecasting dynamic; runger gc, 1995, commun stat theory, v24, p273, doi 10.1080/03610929508831487; tsay rs, 1988, j forecasting, v7, p1, doi 10.1002/for.3980070102; wardell dg, 1994, j qual technol, v26, p308; wardell dg, 1994, technometrics, v36, p3, doi 10.2307/1269191","15","24","29","0","2","amer soc quality control-asqc","1998","340","351","12","atienza, oo; tang, lc; ang, bw","1.09","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","3","0","2","2","1","1","0","2","5","2","2","0","1","0","1","0","2","0","0","0"

"592","log-odds rate and monotone log-odds rate distributions","article","failure rate; log logistic distribution; log-odds rate","since the 1960's, reliability models for time to failure based on monotone failure rate models have become important models of failure time for reliability practitioners. bounds for monotone increasing failure rates (ifr) have been developed and are especially useful for bounding the hazard of aging. recently, however, it appears that the ifr model as a model of aging may be too stringent for some modern components. this supposition is confirmed by the widespread use of the log normal model to describe time to failure. this paper introduces a new time-to-failure model based on the log-odds rate (lor) which is comparable to the model based on the failure rate. it is shown that failure-time distributions can be characterized by lor and that the increasing lor (ilor) model in terms of log time (ln(t)) is less stringent than the ifr model for aging. it is shown that the logistic distribution has the property of a constant lor and that the log-logistic distribution has the property of a constant lor with respect to ln(t). some properties of ilor distributions are presented and bounds based on the relationship to the log-logistic distribution are provided for distributions which are ilor with respect to ln(t). examples of the use of the bounds are also presented, and examples of the comparisons of the ilor bounds with the ifr bounds are made.","univ new mexico, dept math & stat, albuquerque, nm 87131 usa; roosevelt univ, sch sci & math, chicago, il 60605 usa","zimmer, wj (reprint author), univ new mexico, dept math & stat, albuquerque, nm 87131 usa.","barlow r. e., 1975, stat theory reliabil; barlow re, 1966, ann math stat, v37, p1593, doi 10.1214/aoms/1177699150; barlow re, 1963, ann math stat, v34, p375, doi 10.1214/aoms/1177704147; barlow re, 1966, ann math stat, v37, p1574, doi 10.1214/aoms/1177699149; barlow rf, 1965, math theory relabili; kaufmann ad, 1977, math models study re; martz h., 1982, bayesian reliability; nelson w., 1982, appl life data anal; zimmer wj, 1998, j qual technol, v30, p386","9","10","10","0","1","amer soc quality control-asqc","1998","376","385","10","zimmer, wj; wang, y; pathak, pk","0.45","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","2","1","1","0","1","2","0"

"600","control charts applicable when the fraction nonconforming is small","article","control charts; normal distribution; parts-per-million nonconforming items; weibull distribution","it has been proposed that when the proportion of nonconforming product is extremely small that one base 3 sigma control charts on the 0.2777(th) power of x, the number of items sampled until a nonconforming item is found. this choice of exponent renders the transformed variable approximately normal in distribution. in this paper, that proposal is compared to the alternative of using a logarithmic transformation of x as the basis for 3 sigma control charts. expressions are derived for the oc curves of both procedures. it is shown further that if probability limits are used in lieu of 3 sigma limits, the oc curves of the two procedures are identical. if probability limits are used, the power transformation is preferred to the log transform, since of the two, its distribution is more nearly normal and, thus, more closely justifies the use of the supplementary tests commonly used to enhance the power of control charts. computation of the average run lengths shows that the power transformation gives poor protection against worsening quality and that the log transformation results in an unacceptably short in-control arl value. it is shown that either transformed value gives greatly improved performance when used in an ewma scheme. the power transformation is recommended over the log transformation as the basis for an ewma chart because it will detect an increase in the fraction nonconforming of up to a factor of three with a smaller resultant arl. moreover, it will detect any decrease in the fraction nonconforming more quickly.","penn state great valley, dept ind & mfg engn, malvern, pa 19355 usa; merck & co inc, bottle mfg, w point, pa 19486 usa","mccool, ji (reprint author), penn state great valley, dept ind & mfg engn, malvern, pa 19355 usa.","johnson nl, 1970, continuous univariat, v1; lucas jm, 1985, technometrics, v27, p129, doi 10.2307/1268761; lucas jm, 1990, technometrics, v32, p1, doi 10.2307/1269835; montgomery d. c., 1996, intro stat quality c; montgomery dc, 1991, intro stat quality c; nelson ls, 1994, j qual technol, v26, p239; pitman j, 1993, probability","7","29","29","0","4","amer soc quality control-asqc","1998","240","247","8","mccool, ji; joyner-motley, t","1.32","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","2","0","1","1","2","1","3","1","3","1","1","1","3","1","3","1","1","1","0"

"648","quality loss functions for optimization across multiple response surfaces","article","loss functions; multiple responses; process optimization; robust design","most manufactured products must conform to multiple ''fitness for use'' criteria. the manufacturing design must balance these different needs and find settings of design parameters that maximize product quality. this paper proposes the use of quadratic quality loss functions applied to response surface models to solve this multiple criterion problem. the discussion concentrates on the premanufacturing phase, when off-target losses predominate over losses due to random variability, but the methodology is equally applicable to situations in which both sources contribute appreciably to quality losses. it is shown that operating a process at the minimum of the loss function has the additional benefit of minimizing sensitivity of the product to noise variation in the design parameter settings, leading to robust designs automatically.","polaroid corp,div engn,waltham,ma 02154; szonyi associates,lexington,ma 02173; univ minnesota,chair appl stat,st paul,mn 55108","ames, ae (reprint author), polaroid corp,film imaging div,waltham,ma 02154, usa.","aubin jp, 1984, explicit methods opt; box g, 1988, technometrics, v30, p1, doi 10.2307/1270311; box g, 1960, technometrics, v2, p455, doi doi 10.1080/00401706.1960.10489912; box g. e., 1987, empirical model buil; clausing d, 1990, harvard business jan, p65; cochran w. g, 1957, expt designs; delcastillo e, 1993, j qual technol, v25, p199; derringer g, 1980, j qual technol, v12, p214; derringer gc, 1994, qual prog, v27, p51; dixon lcw, 1980, nonlinear optimizati; fiacco av, 1990, nonlinear programmin; friedman a, 1991, math ind problems 4, p169; hahn gj, 1984, technometrics, v26, p19, doi 10.2307/1268412; hauser jr, 1988, harvard business may, p65; khuri ai, 1996, response surfaces; lambert r, 1989, j imaging technol, v15, p108; lucas jm, 1994, j qual technol, v26, p248; lucas jm, 1992, technometrics, v34, p149; mccaskill es, 1989, j imaging technol, v15, p103; meneghini f, 1989, j imaging technol, v15, p114; montgomery d. c., 1997, design anal expt; myers r. h., 1995, response surface met; myers rh, 1973, technometrics, v15, p301, doi 10.2307/1266990; myers rh, 1989, technometrics, v31, p137, doi 10.2307/1268813; phadke ms, 1982, p am stat ass sect s, p11; ross pj, 1988, tag techniques quali; sturge jm, 1989, imaging processes ma; taguchi g., 1979, off line quality con; taguchi  genichi, 1986, intro quality eng; tribus m, 1989, qual prog, v22, p46; vining gg, 1990, j qual technol, v22, p38","31","95","99","1","5","amer soc quality control-asqc","1997","339","346","8","ames, ae; mattucci, n; macdonald, s; szonyi, g; hawkins, dm","4.13","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","2","1","5","2","7","6","9","2","7","8","5","6","6","5","4","5","8","3","2","0"

"658","run-to-run process control: literature review and extensions","review","engineering process control; feedback control; statistical process control","in the last few years, ''run-to-run'' (r2r) control techniques have been developed and used to control various semiconductor manufacturing processes. these techniques combine response surface, statistical process control, and feedback control techniques. this paper provides a literature review of r2r control methods from a statistical and control engineering point of view. it is shown that self-tuning controllers can provide a valuable control strategy for r2r applications. in this paper we address the single-input-single-output (siso) case. two proposed self-tuning controllers compensate not only for the standard case of process shifts, but also in the case a deterministic trend and/or autocorrelation is present in the observed response (i.e., in case there exist process dynamics). in order to reduce the input variance, a control chart is added to the output and acts as a deadband.","sematech,stat methods grp,austin,tx 78741","delcastillo, e (reprint author), univ texas,dept ind engn,arlington,tx 76019, usa.","astrom karl j., 1990, computer controlled; astrom karl johan, 1970, intro stochastic con; astrom kj, 1973, automatica, v9, p185, doi 10.1016/0005-1098(73)90073-3; astrom kj, 1977, automatica, v13, p457, doi 10.1016/0005-1098(77)90067-x; astrom kj, 1989, adaptive control; boning ds, 1994, ieee t semiconduct m, v7, p233, doi 10.1109/66.286858; box g, 1992, technometrics, v34, p251, doi 10.2307/1270028; box g. e., 1987, empirical model buil; box gep, 1976, technometrics, v18, p371, doi 10.2307/1268651; box gep, 1951, j roy stat soc b, v13, p1; box gep, 1963, b int stat i, v34, p943; box gep, 1994, time series anal; box gep, 1974, time series anal; butler sw, 1994, ieee t semiconduct m, v7, p193, doi 10.1109/66.286855; clarke de, 1975, iee p, v132, p929; gaston gj, 1994, ieee t semiconduct m, v7, p22, doi 10.1109/66.286830; gill pe, 1986, sol86 stanf u; guo rs, 1993, ieee t semiconduct m, v6, p41, doi 10.1109/66.210657; harris tj, 1980, technometrics, v22, p153, doi 10.2307/1268454; hoerl ae, 1970, technometrics, v12, p55; hurwitz a, 1993, 6 natl s stat des au; ingolfsson a, 1993, j qual technol, v25, p271; ljung l., 1987, system identificatio; ljung l, 1987, theory practice recu; macgregor jf, 1977, p i electr eng, v124, p732, doi 10.1049/piee.1977.0158; macgregor jf, 1988, chem eng prog, v84, p21; mandel bj, 1969, j qual technol, v1, p1; montgomery d. c., 1996, intro stat quality c; montgomery dc, 1994, j qual technol, v26, p79; moyne j, 1992, use ultramax process; mozumder pk, 1994, ieee t semiconduct m, v7, p1, doi 10.1109/66.286826; mozumder pk, 1994, ieee t semiconduct m, v7, p400, doi 10.1109/66.311345; mozumder pk, 1993, p ieee semi adv sem, p136; sachs e, 1991, ieee t semiconduct m, v4, p134, doi 10.1109/66.79725; sachs e, 1995, ieee t semiconduct m, v8, p26, doi 10.1109/66.350755; sachs e., 1990, ieee/semi advanced semiconductor manufacturing conference and workshop. world-class manufacturing. asmc '90 proceedings (cat. no.90ch2902-5), p126, doi 10.1109/asmc.1990.111236; sachs e, 1991, p ieee semi adv sem, p104; shah sl, 1991, can j chem eng, v69, p89, doi 10.1002/cjce.5450690111; toivonen ht, 1983, automatica, v19, p415, doi 10.1016/0005-1098(83)90056-0; young p. c, 1984, recursive estimation; yunker s, 1992, ultramax continuous","41","122","122","1","22","amer soc quality control-asqc","1997","184","196","13","delcastillo, e; hurwitz, am","5.3","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","5","2","3","8","5","8","9","4","10","6","8","8","8","5","4","9","5","4","2","7","0"

"747","statistical process-control via the subgroup bootstrap","article","bootstrap methods; control limits; shewhart control charts; statistical process control","the most commonly used techniques in statistical process control are parametric, and so they require assumptions regarding the statistical properties of the underlying process. for example, shewhart control charts assume that the observations are independent, and that the statistic of interest is normally distributed, these assumptions are often violated in practice; for example, the distribution of the variable being measured may be strongly skewed or may fail a test for normality. in such cases the control limits, especially for small subgroup samples, may not be accurate. the bootstrap is a computer intensive rp sampling procedure that does not require a priori distribution assumptions. it was developed to find the distribution of a statistic when the distribution is not known. we first extend the bootstrap percentile method to include a series of subgroups, which are typically used in assessing process control limits. we show, via examples, how the subgroup bootstrap is used to assess process control limits for (x) over bar and s-2 charts, via simulation, we then empirically compare the subgroup bootstrap and parametric methods for determining process control limits for a quality related characteristic of a manufacturing process under various conditions, the results show that bootstrap methods for (x) over bar and s-2 control charts generally achieve comparatively better control limit estimates than standard parametric methods, particularly when the assumption of a normal process distribution is not valid. the subgroup bootstrap is easily implemented on a personal computer as a general methodology for statistical process control, and hence, is a potentially useful pragmatic quality improvement tool.","purdue univ,krannert grad sch management,w lafayette,in 47907","seppala, t (reprint author), helsinki univ,helsinki,finland.","alemayehu d., 1990, j appl stat, v17, p357; alwan lc, 1988, j bus econ stat, v6, p87, doi 10.2307/1391421; bajgier s. m, 1992, p dec sci i san dieg, p1611; biddle gc, 1990, auditing-j pract th, v9, p92; bone p. f., 1987, j marketing, v26, p105; bratley p., 1987, guide simulation; burr i. j., 1967, ind quality control, v23, p563; carlstein e, 1992, ima volumes math the; cooil b, 1987, j marketing res, v24, p271, doi 10.2307/3151637; davison ac, 1986, biometrika, v73, p555, doi 10.2307/2336519; devor r. e., 1992, statistical quality; diciccio tj, 1988, j roy stat soc b met, v50, p338; efron b, 1987, j am stat assoc, v82, p171, doi 10.2307/2289144; efron b, 1990, j am stat assoc, v85, p79, doi 10.2307/2289528; efron b, 1979, ann stat, v7, p1, doi 10.1214/aos/1176344552; efron b, 1982, jackknife bootstrap; efron b, 1986, stat sci, v1, p54, doi doi 10.1214/ss/1177013815; fisher ni, 1989, j am stat assoc, v84, p996, doi 10.2307/2290075; franklin la, 1992, j qual technol, v24, p196; gunter b, 1991, qual prog, v24, p97; gunter b, 1991, quality progr 2, v25, p82; gunter b, 1991, quality progr 4, v25, p79; gunter b, 1991, quality progr 3, v25, p119; hall p, 1987, biometrika, v74, p481, doi 10.2307/2336687; hall p, 1988, ann stat, v16, p927, doi 10.1214/aos/1176350933; hall p, 1988, j roy stat soc b met, v50, p35; hall p, 1989, biometrika, v76, p613, doi 10.1093/biomet/76.3.613; kinsella a, 1989, statistician, v38, p175, doi 10.2307/2348872; koksalan m, 1986, estimating percentil; leger c, 1992, technometrics, v34, p378, doi 10.2307/1268938; montgomery dc, 1991, j qual technol, v23, p179; montgomery dc, 1991, intro statistical qu; moskowitz h, 1992, manage sci, v38, p1084; muralidhar k, 1991, simulation, v56, p119, doi 10.1177/003754979105600207; politis d, 1991, 9113 purd u techn re; schilling eg, 1976, j qual technol, v8, p183; shewhart w.a., 1931, ec control quality m; swanepoel jwh, 1990, s afr stat j, v24, p1; wardell dg, 1994, technometrics, v36, p3, doi 10.2307/1269191; wheeler dj, 1986, understanding statis","40","41","42","1","1","amer soc quality control-asqc","1995","139","153","15","seppala, t; moskowitz, h; plante, r; tang, j","1.64","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","2","1","0","0","0","1","2","1","1","4","3","1","2","1","4","3","4","2","4","3","0"
